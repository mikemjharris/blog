Why blog?

Why do I blog? Why does anyone blog?

It's a bit grand to ask myself why I blog when this is the first post. Who knows if I continue. Who knows why or how or when I will continue. I have reasons for starting to blog.  Will those be the reasons why I will blog in the future?  I can pretty much guarantee they wont be. Hopefully I will survive past the first few posts and ease myself into a writing rhythm, find a style and learn a little more about myself and the world.

So why have I started to blog?

<em>If a tree falls in the forest...</em>
If you are a tech person and you build anything without blogging - does that project exist? Well yes - obviously - but a blog is another part of a any good technologists portfolio. As a person who not only plies their career in the tech world but also seems to spend large chucks of my spare time shepparding electrons around digital networks I thought it was high time to start a blog.


<em>Altruistically selfish</em>
Over the years I have devoured in detail the many blogs out there. I am thankful to the many developers who have devoted time to explaining some of the many problems that have tripped them up. If one of my posts can solve one persons problem out there I feel I will have at least started to pay back the huge debt i owe to the community. But there's a selfish reason here too: I find that you can only truly understand a topic if you can explain it to someone else in straightforward terms. Often the process of writing and explaining and researching and experimenting will make you discover and understand a topic in much more detail. 

<em>Fun</em>
I enjoy writing. Who knows if I am any good (the chances are not) but it's fun. I have blogged before but both times were for short, speicifc projects with a clear timeline and structure.  The blogs were more diary than anything else.  But I enjoyed writing - it was stimulating, interesting, satisfying. 


So there we are the three main reasons why I blog.

If you want that in a pithy oneliner summary here goes:

"Self centerd and self absorbed tech guy buys a domain with their own name, publishes their self important 'thoughts' to shamlessly promote themselves in the tech world."
"I want to learn more and educate others in the tech world by doing something I enjoy - writing."
