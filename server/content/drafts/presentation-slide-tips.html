  Presentations are hard but like pretty much any new skill sticking to a few simple rules can really improve what you deliver. This article gives you just two tips - limit your bullet points to max 3 per slide and make them appear as you go.  There you are - you're done!  Go forth and present beautifully!  These are mistakes I most often see new presenters making but often seasoned pros do.  Obviously the better you are the more you can break the rules but if you are at all unconfident or new to presenting stick to the two tips and it will help the audience be more engaged with what you are delivering.
