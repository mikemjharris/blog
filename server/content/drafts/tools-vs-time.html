  In a couple of days I will be running the Tokyo marathon. To obtain the place I prepaid a certain amount in charity. Even if no-one sponsored me I was happy to contribute to a good cause. I am very lucky to have supportive friends and family who generally want to donate money at some point to charity and are happy to sponsor me.  Sites such as Justgiving have made this simple and easy and I have used them previously. This time however I had already paid the sponsorship so was looking to raise money in a different way.

<h4>Building a sponsorship solution.</h4>

<p>
  One option was to go about this in the old school way of asking people to pledge and then going round and collecting money off them. I would reimburse myself a certain amount (I always sponsor myself for any event I do) to cover some of the prepaid costs. Any surplus would then be an additional donation to the charity.
</p>

<p>
  This requires a certain amount of effort and people are so used to being able to pay and sponsor over the internet that I decided I wanted to build out my own solution. In the past year I have worked with stripe so wanted to build my own web app with stripe integration. The more I thought of what sites such as Justgiving do I wanted to add the ability to add messages, have an animated sponsorship bar and other features. All these ideas were a few months back when time seemed plentiful.

<p>
  I had grand plans and on my morning commute would plan out in my head a meteor app and all the functionality I would add.  But life is busy - work is super interesting and busy at my new job at Moo and outside of work I had the usual social commitments as well as the pressure of training for a marathon. It will come as no surprise that time slipped by.
</p>

<h4>Being honest with yourself...</h4>
<p>
  I still felt I had time to build an app around my initial specs but felt it would be rushed. This is going out to close friends and family and would be dealing with real money. It's fine if a fun online project is buggy but for something like this you don't want to get it wrong.  Even if the money was treated well I felt that the overall experience wouldn't be as I wanted. I decided to pair back my expectations.

<h4>MVP</h4>
<p>
  There is lots of talk in the tech world about the MVP - you really appreicate it when you are building something with a specific task!  I needed to collect money and the simplest and most reliable way I had seen on line is paypal me.  You have your own link, the form is simple to fill in and paypal do all teh hard work.  I decided I would build a simple html page, with a clear button linking to paypal for friends and family to support me.  No fancy frameworks, no stripe integration just the minimum I needed.
</p>
<p>
  As such i sat down and in an evening built a simple and to the point webpage. The words were the focus not any fancy stuff. In a couple of hours I had built what I needed, it was simple, fast and looked good on mobile and desktop.  I had my MVP
