meta-blogging.

Blogs come in all shapes and sizes - timeless theological musings, excentric tantrums, inciscive analysis, self important puffing - the whole slice of humanity in short online snippets.  But the saddest blog is the blog that starts off with a fanfare, with a page of intent and promises of life changing posts to come. This sad blog is usually a few years old with maybe one follow up post and then silence.

Blogging is hard - not just the writing but coming up with something to write about. And not just to write once but write again. And again. And be intersting and readable and writable and worth the pain of drafting and thinking and editing and just everything.

From looking and researching it seems that those with something specific to write about blogged best. Too broad or vague the topic the higher the chances of tumbleweed and barren pages.

So here I am wanting to write about tech. How can to be profligate and push past the token intro and give this project a fighting chance of surviving. Focus - focus on what I do: Build something. Write about it.  Build something with all those shiny tech tools I use. Write about how I designed and build a web app, about the pain and problems that dog any project, about the new things I've learnt along the way or maybe jsut how that fool proof piece of regex wasn't so fool proof. Build. Write.

Great, fantastic, awesome! Build. Write. Write Build.

Build what....

The list of things I want to build is long. The list of things that others want me to build is even longer. But wouldn't it be great if the project I built and wrote about I could guarantee the reader had experieinced. They could see and understan the design decisions, they would feel the bugs and the pain and could validate if I had overcome those. Wouldn't it be great if I could blog about building a blog?

Ok, ok - yes it does sound like a whole load of meta, east London, soy latte extra skinny, self indulgent bs. But I've already built an mvp of the blog - you're reading it now.  It is a side project squeezed into the small gaps that life sometimes provided but it does give an idea of the thoughts and process that I put into building a project. There were some interesting decisions along the way and some new tools and problems I had to overcome.  I reckon there are enough navel gazing, meta posts in this project to pollinate the blog and hope it is flourishes into something beautiful.

The aim for the next few posts will take you through an overview of the tools used and desicisions made.  I'll talk a little about everything from front end, backend, data storage, blog api, version control and my home brewed continuous intergration solution.  The blog is up and running but contstantly evolving - let's hope I can balance tweaking things with actually writing about the topics I plan to!





What to write oh what to write.  Tech - this is definitely a techy themed blog so let's write some tech.

What I need is a project. Lots of challneges in a project

 something I can build and can write about

If only I could think of some project to build that would show a bit about how I go

One of the hardest parts of a blog is finding suitable topics to write about.

One of the many reasons for writing a blog was to demonstarte how I go about building web apps.

What could be better than to actually build a blog, write about the design challenges and technical issues along the way. Surely this would give me a few weeks of interesting topics to right about as well as a warm fuzzy glow of being so wonderfully modern and meta.

Life is pretty busy - this project has been squeezed and massaged into the few gaps that appear over the weeks. This is very much a minimal viable product - the same rigours I apply to my day job aren't possible when grabing the off ten minutes to code.
