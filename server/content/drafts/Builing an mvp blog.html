meta-blogging.

Blogs come in all shapes and sizes - timeless theological musings, excentric tantrums, inciscive analysis, self important puffing - the whole slice of humanity in short online snippets.  But the saddest blog is the blog that starts off with a fanfare, with a page of intent and promises of life changing posts to come. This sad blog is usually a few years old with maybe one follow up post and then silence. 

Blogging is hard - not just the writing but coming up with something to write about. And not just to write once but write again. And again. And be intersting and readable and writable and worth staying up late and worth scribbling down a few thoughts on the bus, and thinking about before bed and typing away furiously on a snatched coffee break.  

Those with somehting specific to write about wrote about it. Too broad or vague the attempt the higher the chances of tumbleweed and barren pages.

So here I am wanting to write about tech. How to be profligate and fertile and push past the token intro and give this project a fighting chance of surviving. Focus - focus on what I do: Build something. Write about it.  Build something with all those shiny tech tools I use.Write about how I designed and build a web app, about the pain and problems that dog any project, about the new things I've learnt along the way or maybe jsut how that fool proof piece of regex wasn't so fool proof. Build. Write.

Great, fantastic, awesome! Build. Write. Write Build. 

Build what....

Building isn't hard - the list of things I want to build is long. The list of things that others want me to build is even longer. 





What to write oh what to write.  Tech - this is definitely a techy themed blog so let's write some tech.  

What I need is a project. Lots of challneges in a project 

 something I can build and can write about 

If only I could think of some project to build that would show a bit about how I go 

One of the hardest parts of a blog is finding suitable topics to write about.

One of the many reasons for writing a blog was to demonstarte how I go about building web apps. 

What could be better than to actually build a blog, write about the design challenges and technical issues along the way. Surely this would give me a few weeks of interesting topics to right about as well as a warm fuzzy glow of being so wonderfully modern and meta. 

Life is pretty busy - this project has been squeezed and massaged into the few gaps that appear over the weeks. This is very much a minimal viable product - the same rigours I apply to my day job aren't possible when grabing the off ten minutes to code.
