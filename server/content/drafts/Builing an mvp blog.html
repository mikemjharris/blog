Builing an mvp blog

One of the hardest parts of a blog is finding suitable topics to write about.

One of the many reasons for writing a blog was to demonstarte how I go about building web apps. 

What could be better than to actually build a blog, write about the design challenges and technical issues along the way. Surely this would give me a few weeks of interesting topics to right about as well as a warm fuzzy glow of being so wonderfully modern and meta. 

Life is pretty busy - this project has been squeezed and massaged into the few gaps that appear over the weeks. This is very much a minimal viable product - the same rigours I apply to my day job aren't possible when grabing the off ten minutes to code.
