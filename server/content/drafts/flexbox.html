  I've been meaning to write about flexbox for a while. I used it to produce most of the layout of this blog and the more projects I use it with the more I enjoy using it. It solves a whole range of problems that used to be very hard, hacky or impossible to fix.

<p>
  I meant to produce a whole range of examples but the past two months have been taken up with changing jobs and travelling! For now take my word for it and a whole host of people on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=flexbox&src=typd" target="_blank">twitter</a>
</p>

<p>
  I would suggest having this <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" target="_blank">css tricks guide to flexbox open</a>. For about six months this was my most visited website and I know that many others have found it essential.

  One quick example - I use codepen all the time.  Generally to show something off the best place is for it to be right in the middle of the view.  This is a real pain without flexbox - with flexbox it means adding the following rules to the body (or container element). See the embedded pen below for an example.
  <code>
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  </code>
