  One of the last 'normal' things I did at the start of the year was to go swimming in London fields Lido on the 19th March.  That week there had already been a raft of announcements - parts of life closing down and vulnerable people shielding.  That morning the lady on reception said they would be aiming to stay open. By the end of the week they were shut. Horizons shrunk to our homes, activites curtailed, lockdown started.
</p>
<p>
  The next time I went swimming was the 5th June - since then it has been one of the joys of the summer and has helped the mind and body get reaccustomed to a wider post lockdown world with loosening limits. Here's my story of paddling through a pandemic.

<h3>Lockdown</h3>
<p>
  The initial fear and uncertainty at the end of March gave way to a regular, monotomous routine in April jarringly punctuated by the horrific news. I was incredibly fortunate and privileged to have a fairly easy and stable lockdown. But by May I was craving something new - I took a week off work and on a cycle through town saw swimmers in the Serpentine - but they'd been overwhelmed and had already stopped new members signing up.</p>
<p>
  So swimming was a possibility!  I kept my eyes peeled to see if any other venues were opening - particularly for news from the wonderful swim twitter community. In early June Sally Goble posted one of her excellent Postcards From the Pool about swimming in a new venue in the Isle of dogs. Excited I looked into it, replied to Sally's tweet and found out we'd both be there at the same time.  It was so exciting to have a new activity booked, to go somewhere new and to catch up with a friend!

<h3>Millwall Docks</h3>
  <p>
    There was a huge demand for swimming and due to the size of the venue and social distancing slots were at a premium. The Weekend was full but managed to get a Thursday morning 10am, 6th June. Up early, bag packed I cycled along the network of canals that link where I live to the Isle of Dogs. It was a workday but one of the benefits of the pandemic has been more flexible working.  At 9.30 I took my morning standup with other tech leads on the edge of a murkey Thames, thirty minutes I was stood on the side of the docks frantically waving at Sally who I'd just spotted across the car park.  We became twitter friends a while agoe and both work in tech and enjoy swimming - we've mainly chatted online but managed to meet up last year in real life at the Lido. It was amazing to see someone not on a zoom call, a fresh face, a different experience of the last few weeks.

  Read Sally's post for a brilliant view of what the docks are like - you can see how peacefule, calm and industrial they are from the pic above.  I changed, signed in, queued up and then was in to the murkey, fresh water.  It was invigorating, cool and amazing. What a joy to be back in the water! For the next thirty minutes I thrashed around, no rhythem, no feel for the water, crisscrossing around, mind buzzing, water splashing. An absolute terrible swim but the most amazing one at the same time.  Afterwards I had the tough task of shaking some warmth back into my hands and trying to wipe the joyful smile off my face. What a treat.
</p>

<p>
  Sally got me into advanced warning booking whatsapp group. This was to become commonplace for all the swimming venues - when and how to book a slot. A week later I jogged the 10k to the docks, swam then got a take away coffee and sat with Sally and a group of her swimming friends catching up. This was all still new, everyone sat far apart, a fizz of anxiety but big smiles as we chatted swimming and lockdown.

<h3>West Reservoir</h3>
<p>News that West Reservoir rippled out across the swim community - I got a slot - again mid week - Thursday 18th June.  It's only round the corner to me in Stoke Newington but I've only swam there once or twice - many years I put it off as it required booking an induction course and then I found the slots were at the wrong time or you got there and found it was full. Excited to be back somewhere I'd been I cycled through the deserted streets of North East london - cars were stil in lockdown - there was nowhere for people to go. There was an excited line of socially distanced people outside - How does it work? Where do you change? I went last week! It's my first time. Whats the temperature like?  How was your lockdown? It's so good to be out!
</p>

<p>
  Then we were in, a quick briefing, a spacious quay to change in the sun, a polite queue and then into the water.  There are no straight edges here unlike in a pool or the docks.  The round reservoir and skewy circular route helped free the mind.  The strange out and dog lef left at the tictac, a glance as you crossed over hoemcoming paddlers and you were out!  Kayaks keeping watch around the course, murkey water to imerse your head in and block out the world around you for 40 marvelous minutes.  Dripping as you returned to shore, dropping off your tow buoy (required for non wetsuits) and drying yourself off in the sun. Glorious.
</p>

<p>West Resevoir became my regular - there were slots all day long and it was moments from home. The flexibility of work meaning I didn't need to compete for the busy morning and late afternoon slots - often turning up for a quick dip in early afternoon, enjoying some sun and then back to the keyboard revitalised.  Met up with friends from a swimming holiday a previous year: we swam, sat in clissold park and enjoyed pizza and beer.  I met another twitter friend for the first time IRL there (hi charlotte) and of course I spotted Sally. Seeing the morning sun, swimming in evening dusk, bathing in weekend sun.  My happy place. Massive thank you to Ricky and the team there for such a well run and welcoming location

<h3>Olympic Park</h3>

<p>
  So far open air seemed safer in a pandemic world but by the end of August the numbers were lower and the right measures in place for pools to open. The Olympic pool in Straford in even closer than West Reservoir. They've done a brilliant job with the Olympic park and the pool is one of the highlights - the Zaha Hadid designed whales tongue is a stunning building and the facilities are top notch.  It's also part of the better group who do affordable exercise and also look after london fields lido, west reservoir among others. I booked a slot, cycled over, got confused by the one way system inside and where to change and then into the pool.  After months of open water swimming the pool felt strange - the freedom and random directions were replaced with linear, regular lengths. It was a different feeling - more contained but smoother, more focused, more rhythmic.  They're alomost differnet sports and was good for a change.

<h3>London Fields Lido</h3>
<img src="/images/london-fields-lido-swim-small.jpg" alt="London Fields Lido" />
<p>The lido had been open for a while too but slots were at a premium - whereas the olympic pool was bookable just before arriving the lido required alarms being set a week before.  Finally got my chance and in the last week I was back in the Lido.  This is where I fell back in love with swimming - I took lessons here a few years ago when I moved to the area as was struggling to swim a length.  A couple of days a week, especially in the summer, I;ll arrive early, have a swim and then sit and read a book in the sun trap to the side with a coffee and croissant - before heading off to work. I'd been so looking forward to more of the same this summer especially as I'd changed jobs to one with an office round the corner so I could maximise sun and reading. But I hadn't been since days before lockdown in mid March.
</p>
<p>
  It was weird being back, areas roped off, no lingering after but the pool was the same, the all year round heated water, the trees and sky still cheering you on. And then I spotted a regular, and another.  I caught up with the lovely elderly couple who have the same favourite spot by the side of the pool.  We've been chatting and reading books together for years - so happy they had a safe lockdown.
</p>
<p>
  It was great to be back.  A touch of melancholy at a missed summer and a reminder of the pandemic and all the destruction and upset it's caused.  It's been weird in a bubble at home and cycling to new spots like the west reservoir - like a fantasy world with the news in the background equally unreal.  But back to a normal routine and that brings some of the harshness of the current reality to the forefront.
</p>


<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>
   The days are getting shorter, leaves are changing colour and there's a chill not just in the air but in the water too.  The news too is changing - the warm denial of summer has given way to the cooling reality of a second wave.  The short days and temperature will mean few open water swims - maybe the odd dip for the invigorating feeling. Back to the heated lido and the olympic pool.  But further restrictions may curtail those or incresed demand may mean it's harder to book.  But things change and am happy to have had a glorious summer of swimming. A few weeks of celebrating and mournign the changes and then a new season.  The indoor bike comes into it's own again, I've got a number of trail runs lined up and lazing on the sofa with a hot drink is also very enticing. Swimming has helped me throught he last few months.  Let's see how we're doing next year - if the pademic is still as it is now at least I'll have the hope magical moments at the west reservoir to help us through it.

<h4>Thanks</h4>

  Swimming has always been my fun sport, the one I don't take too seriously. A childhood of playing in the sea in Cornwall for holidays, a lapse in adulthood then a move to Hackney where the lido lured me in. I was happy in the water but would run out of puff - I took lessons to try and improve my technique. The lido became my regular pre work stop off - most days I would pop by even if for a few lengths.  Summers I'd then spend up to an hour or two sunning myself on the side while reading a book before heading off to work.  It was blissful. The 19th March was a fresh chilly day - a rush from the changing room to the pool, hoping for warmer weather to come so I could go back to my little paddle, sun and reading routing.And then it was over, covid arrived and lockdown.

<h3>Dorking Quarry</h3>

<p>
  Mid august restrictions had lifted enough to visit my parents. My mum had been open water swimming too and she took me to her favourite spot in Dorking. After mostly being in London getting out of town was super refreshing as was swimming in a new location.  Perhaps the most picturesque of them all? The months of concern for parents safety was washed away by being able to share some time splashing around outside.
