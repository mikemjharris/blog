  One of the last 'normal' things I did at the start of the year was to go swimming in London fields Lido on the 19th March.  That week there had already been a raft of announcements with some parts of life shutting down and vulnerable people shielding.  That morning the lady on reception said they would be aiming to stay open. By the end of the week they were shut. Horizons shrunk to our homes, activites curtailed, lockdown started.

<p>
  The next time I went swimming was the 5th June - since then it has been one of the joys of the summer and has helped the mind and body get re accustomed to a wider world with loosening limits. Here's my story of paddling through a pandemic.
<h3>Me and Swimming</h3>
<p>
  Swimming has always been my fun sport, the one I don't take too seriously. A childhood of playing in the sea in Cornwall for holidays, a lapse in adulthood then a move to Hackney where the lido lured me in. I was happy in the water but would run out of puff - I took lessons to try and improve my technique. The lido became my regular pre work stop off - most days I would pop by even if for a few lengths.  Summers I'd then spend up to an hour or two sunning myself on the side while reading a book before heading off to work.  It was blissful. The 19th March was a fresh chilly day - a rush from the changing room to the pool, hoping for warmer weather to come so I could go back to my little paddle, sun and reading routing.And then it was over, covid arrived and lockdown.

<h3>Lockdown</h3>
<p>
  The initial fear and uncertainty at the end of March gave way to a regular, monotomous routine in April only punctuated by the horrific news. I was incredigly fortunate and privellidged to have a fairly easy and stable lockdown. But by May I was craving something new - I took a week off work and on a cycle through town saw swimmers in the Serpentine.  Excited I got back home and looked into getting the required membership. I left it a few days and when I came back I found they had been swamped and memberships had been suspended.</p>
<p>
  So swimming was a possibility!  I kept my eyes peeled to see if any other venues were opening. Swimmign twitter if a brillient community - I first got into it by seeing a post about Sally Goble - she was also in tech and a fanatical swimmer.  In early June she posted the following tweet which inspired me to book my first swim since march - and as it happened I'd be catching up with Sally.  We'd been twitter buddies for a while and caughts up once briefly at the Lido - it was exciting to have a plan to go somewhere, see a friend and do an activity!

  Most childhood holidays involved traveling down to see my Grandparents in Cornwall with endless days walking the cliffs, clambering on rocks and playing in the sea. I was very comfortable in the water but mainly swam breast stroke - in the sea you want to look up and around and are mainly swimming for fun or to play around. There were some swimming lessons in leisure centres and at school but not real training - I was happy being comfortable and didn't want to swim for speed.
</p>
<p>
  Adult life generally meant little swimming - I didn't go to pools but did enjoy being in the water on holiday.  I entered a triathlon and realised I struggled to swim far using front crawl so did the race mainly with breast stroke.  In 2013 I moved to Hackney and decided to try out the heated open air Lido at London fields. I loved it.

  <p> Swimming was so different from my main sport, running, as was my attitude.  Swimming was a way to relax and chill, pootle up and down the lane imitating a frog.  I was keen though to see if I could do more than a length of front crawl.   I popped along to swim doctor lessons, running, as was my attitude.
