  Graphql is one of the new exciting technologies that I've been meaing to try out.  As usual I try and find a personal project I've wanted to build and use that as the incentive to build something and learn a new skill.


Since 2012 I've been keeping a google spreasheet with all the books I've been reading.  I find it super helpful to help me remeber what I've read.  It's also been useful as I've tried to expand the range of literature I consume which I've written more about in a couple of previous posts in this blog: <a href="/posts/book-balance" target="_blank">book balance</a> and <a href="/posts/accidental-sexist" target="_blank">accidental sexist</a>. 


  When I've shared posts from this blog on twitter in the past the experience is pretty bare with just a url showing up. I've been meaning to improve the how this works and finally got round to what was a fairly small tweak.

<h4>Twitter cards</h4>
<p>
By providing some meta data on your page twitter can pull out some info and create a better looking post. Twitter creates a 'twitter card' with a title, summary and an image. All this info is on the page - I followed the instructions <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards.html" target="_blank">provided by twitter</a> and added the relevant meta data.
</p>

<p>
  Twitter often caches urls and their meta data so any previously shared urls might not pick up the updates.  There is a <a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator" tartget="_blank">validator</a> you can use to check the setup.  Here's a screenshot of my last post in the validator.  Looks much smarter and more trustworthy to click on!
