  2022 offered all the delights of a more open world - a craving for expanded horizons, wilderness and to experience remote work without being stuck at home. These were all came to pass - only hampered throughout by a bad back.

<h4>Stats</h4>
<p>
  The start of the year was very intense with a new high profile role at an early <a href="https://flown.com">stage startup</a> and a hard deadline to hit.  I think extended hours at a desk triggered a bad back which in turn brought on bad sciatica - weeks of pain, not being able to sit down or exercise.
</p>
<p>This becaume the main factor in the stats for the year.  The first few months completely out of action - only slowly being able to swim and then yoga. Almost no cycling for the year and only some running in the last few months.
</p>

<p>
  Here we are at the end of the year - the bad back and sciatica healed but still a slight physical and mental scratichness linger.
</p>

<h4>Wilderness</h4>
<p>
  The craving of something wild and remote after the last few years led to a trip for a 5k swim event in formentera, a long weekend kayaking and wild camping in Sweden plus a two week trip to the Norwegian arctic circle and a week as crew on a boat round the lofoton islands.

<h4>Remote work</h4>
<p>
 One of the goals for changing careers to be in tech was to one day work remotely.  Last year was work from home - this year was the chance to properly remote work which my new job allowed.  The original dream ten years ago was to be tapping away on a laptop on a beach. The reality this year has been staying with friends and family across the UK and Europe (Cornwall, Spain, Germany, Switzerland). It's been a joy being able to share in others lives on extended visits while still being able to work and not breaking the bank on accomodation.
</p>

<h4>Books and art and stuff</h4>
<p>
 This year  <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com/">17 female authors vs 13 male</a> - 10% ethnically contrasting voices. I love to read books based on where I travel and this year got back to that habit and Per Petersons Out Stealing Horses was a brilliant read about Norway but also one of the best books of the year.  Jo Nesbo was a joy.  Other favourite's included Laura Cumming's Vanishing Man and 41 False Starts by Janet Malcom.  Recurring themese included Las Meninas and early 20th Century households.
</p>
<p>Art and theatre - <a href="http://instagram.com/mikemjharris">loads of trips this year</a> - but the main highlight was the discovery of the Tate late pass.  With a busy world again being able to visit galleries in midweek evenings was a treat.
</p>
<p>
  With life more open I managed a repeat visit to Cornwall with the London literary salon.  That brought together all the strands of the year into a few days - remote work, family, art, reading and some wilderness.  Wrote more about it in one of the only posts of the year (bad back and busy work meant little appetite for more time at the keyboard) - <a href="/posts/the-waves-to-the-lighthouse">Riding the waves to the lighthouse</a>.  With a busy life some of the other hobbies of the last year, such as gardening, took a less prominant role.

<h4>Resolutions</h4>
<p>
  Mainly try and remember to do all the things I already know about to prevent having a bad back again next year - work hard but regular breaks, lots of stretching and consistent yoga.  All of that has happened in the second half of the year and I feel much better for it.
</p>
<p>
  The other resolution is to do better at taking the train for trips to Europe - many of the trips I started looking at train options but left it too late when time and costs meant flying was too attractive an option. Aim is to use travel by rail for anything on mainland Europe that is less than 1000km away.
</p>
<p> The break from running also meant I had a new found love and energy for it at the end of the year.  Hopeing to carry that into the new year and get back to entering a few events.  My mum's signed us up to a 100km weekend trail run/walk/camp to celebrate her 70th so that's something to aim for.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
  The pain and discomfort of a bad back coloured the year.  While looming large in the mind doing this reflection helps remember that plenty of other things happened and to appreciate the healing since then.  </p>
<p>The wilderness and remote work have helped balance out the last few years of restrictions. The new job has been hectic and a steep learning curve but have grown into it and am relishing the challenge of where we can get to in 2023.
</p>
<p>So a 2023 of rail, movement, stretching and hopefully some more wilderness. Hope you have a good one!</p>
