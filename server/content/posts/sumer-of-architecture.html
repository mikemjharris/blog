  Sometimes by design or chance or some beautiful combination of both a topic can keep popping up at regular intervals.  This summer it was architecture - through a work trip to Chicago and a holiday to Germany I got to see experience some iconic buildings on two continents often with similar themes or indeed the same architect.

<h3>Skycrappers of Chicago</h3>
<p>
  The windy city is where the first skyscrapper was built and is reknown for it's archtecture and architects.  When asking on twitter for recommendations the Chicago Architecture Centre came up regularly both becaus it's a top attraction and also they are a client of Tessitura (an arts ticketing and CRM system) who were organising the conference we had travelled for.

  Whilst the visit to Chicago was work based we were lucky to have a few days before and after the conference. During those managed to take the river boat tour organised by the Chicago Architecture centre.  The river winds through the centre of chicago and you can see a whole range buildings but the most impressive being the diverse style of skyscrappers. The city was altered dramatically by the great fire of 1871. Impressive feats of engineering such as reversing the flow of the river and also the amazing forward planning of  Daniel Burnham.

  The Architecture Centre is housed in an impressive Mies Van der Rohe skyscrapper.  Mies' career started in Germany and he was famously director of the Bauhaus in the early 30s - which leads me on to my second trip of the summer.

<h3>100 years of Bauhuas</h3>
<p>
  This year was the celebration of 100 years of Bauhaus.  There are a number of new museums, refurbished houses and events happening throughout Germany to mark the anniversary and I decided to spend some of my summer holiday traveling through the key areas. This included a new museum in Weimar, eating at the Bauhuas designed Kornhaus on the river XXX but the highligh was staying in one of the student rooms in the refurbished Bauhaus builinng in Dessau.
