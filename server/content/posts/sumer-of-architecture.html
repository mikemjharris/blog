  Sometimes by design or chance or some beautiful combination of both a topic can keep popping up at regular intervals.  This summer it was architecture - through a work trip to Chicago and a holiday to Germany I got to see experience some iconic buildings on two continents often with similar themes or indeed the same architect.
</p>

<h3>Skycrappers of Chicago</h3>
<p>
  The windy city is where the first skyscrapper was built and is reknown for it's archtecture and architects.  When asking on twitter for recommendations the <a href="http://www.architecture.org/" target="_blank">Chicago Architecture Centre</a> came up regularly both becaus it's a top attraction and also they are a client of Tessitura (an arts ticketing and CRM system) who were organising the conference we had travelled for.

<p>
  Whilst the visit to Chicago was work based we were lucky to have a few days before and after the conference. During those managed to take the river boat tour organised by the Chicago Architecture centre.  The river winds through the centre of chicago and you can see a whole range buildings but the most impressive being the diverse style of skyscrappers. The city was altered dramatically by the great fire of 1871. Impressive feats of engineering such as reversing the flow of the river and also the amazing forward planning of  Daniel Burnham.

<p>
  The Architecture Centre is housed in an impressive Mies Van der Rohe skyscrapper.  Mies' career started in Germany and he was famously director of the Bauhaus in the early 30s - which leads me on to my second trip of the summer.

<h3>100 years of Bauhuas</h3>
<p>
  This year was the celebration of 100 years of Bauhaus.  There are a number of new museums, refurbished houses and events happening throughout Germany to mark the anniversary and I decided to spend some of my summer holiday traveling through the key areas. This included visiting a new Bauhaus museum in Weimar, eating at the Bauhuas designed Kornhaus and visiting the masters houses. The highlight was staying in one of the student rooms in the refurbished Bauhaus building in Dessau.

<p>
The building is iconic and was built to bauhas designs when the school move from Weimar in the 20s. I've seen many pictures and there is the risk that in person the reality isn't as good but this was different - this was super impressive. Everything clean, clear lines and beautifully laid out.  The student rooms had been done up in a bare, tastful style with each of them having one of the iconic curve balconies.</p>

<p>
Away from the Bauhaus there was so much more architecture - from the stunning rebuilding of Dresden after the bombings in the war through to the more classical buildings in Weimar.  One house though was unexpectedly impressive - the <a href="https://www.klassik-stiftung.de/en/haus-hohe-pappeln/" target="_blank">Haus Hohe Pappeln</a> in Weimar.  This was build in 1907 and was a complete work of art with the arcitect, Van de Velde, desiging the house from the inside out with an eye to function.  He also chose the colours and designed the interior decoration. The look and feel reminded me again of Chicago and the work of another famous architect...

<h3>Frank Lloyd Wright</h3>

<p>
  In chicago around the turn of the 19th Century Frank Lloyd Fright was starting to make a name for himself.  During our trip we had taken the chance to look round his house and studio and the world famouse Robie house (pic). Stunning.  Again there was the focus on design, function, how a person felt as they moved trhough the house, how the light worked and where children could play.  An absolute delight.

<h3>Looking further</h3>
  <p>
    Historical discriminations means that major accomplishments are by often by white men - for example the ones referenced in this post. The world is changing as as we change opportunities are open to a wider demographic. For example <a href="http://www.architecture.org/news/historic-chicago/4-women-architects-in-chicago-history-you-should-know/" target="_blank">this article</a> lists some of the key female Chicago architects. Also in the past women (and others) achievements weren't recognised.  <a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/event/lucia-moholy-nagy-and-the-image-of-architecture-photography-Talk" target="_blank">This talk</a> at the RA was very interesting about the photos of Lucia Moholy and their impact on the Bauhaus story.

<h3>Summer of Architecture</h3>

<p>
  This is a small taster of some of the sights of the summer. I learnt a whole lot about architecture, design and so much more - and it was so interesting to have many common threads weaving through both trips.  Happy share to share thoughts and ideas and provide what tips where I can - just drop me a message.  See below for some books and articles that I found helpful.
