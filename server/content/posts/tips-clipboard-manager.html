  One of the best tools I started using was a clipboard manager.  So many times I was frustrated that I'd copied, say, a cell in excel. I needed to paste it over the top of something else - but need the contents of that destination cell elsewhere. Either I needed to think well ahead of my actions or go through a laborious manual process of pasting somewhere else first.  I often thought - there should be an easier way.  There is! A clipboard manager and you can copy away to your hearts content without the worry of losing what you've copied.

<h4>What to use</h4>
<p>
I've got used to using <a href="https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/">CopyQ</a>.  It works smoothly and most importantly I've got the shortcuts memorized.  
</p>
<p>
There's plenty of others out there - search your favourite app store.  Windows has a native one built in now too. 
</p>

<h4>What can it copy!</h4>

<p> 
Everything!  In writing this blog post I copied the CopyQ url but didn't need to paste it until I needed it. Once I got to the paragraph above I ctrl-shift-h 'd  , a quick filter and there it was.

<p>
This blog needed a pic at some point - so I took a screenshot of the CopyQ pop up window.  It's still sat there - shortly I'll save it, copy it over to this project and use it in this article. But no rush - it's safe in my clipboard manager.


<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
  It's a simple tool that I use multiple times an hour. Find one, use one and save the all the frustration when lose the thing you just copied.
