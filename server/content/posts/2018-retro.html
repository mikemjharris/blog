<p>
A look back at 2018 and the parts of life that went well or badly. LIfe throws lots at you and both at the personal or macro level (such as global political changes or terminal illnesses for friends) which you have little control over. In this post I wanted to focus on areas of my life I felt I did have can impact on the outcome. While learning and analysing mistakes is important I think it is equally valuable to celebrate and enjoy life when things work out.

<h4>Year in numbers</h4>
<p>
 I monitor and track a few easily measurable parts of my life. It's interesting to see how my habits and focus changes over the years. Mainly I track books I've read and the exercise I do.  These are the stats for this year:

Looking at those it looks like a pretty stellar year - read almost double the number of books as last year (which was pretty much a record year) ran 50% more than each of the previous two years (and the most I've ever run by a few KM) and written the most blog posts. It <b>was</b> a stellar year but not necessarily for the numbers reflected in these stats. In the next few paragraphs I'll explain the real story behind the numbers.

<h4>The biggest impact on my year... working in the arts</h4>
<p>
  At the end of 2017 I joined the Royal Academy of Arts as the Tech Lead and for numerous reasons this has impacted huge areas of my life. Some of the impact is for mundane reasons - I now have a longer commute which has contributed to both running and reading more.  Other impact is more inspirational - working in the arts is an amazing environment and I've been inspired to learn more about arts and culture than at any other point in my life.  It's given me the urge to read and understand more, the confidence to expose myself to new experiences and to break down mental barriers.  The group of people I get to work with every day is hugely different from any other of my previous jobs. There has been hard work along the way and I've enjoyed balancing coding along with managing a team.  Mistakes have been made and learnt from, there's been good and helpful feedback along the way and I've progressed personally and professionally.

<h4>Running more doesn't necessarliy mean a good year of running</h4>
  <p>
      This year I ran the most that I've ever run! Previous best was 1,639km in 2012 (although I think I might of run more in 2008 but didn't keep a full record). So it must of been a great year of running?  Well - not so much. The year started off well but an achilles tendon from overdoing the running in March meant I was injured for the London Marathon and missed out on that and I was still recovering and posted probably my worst half marathon time at the Hackney Half (we run that each year with the techrunners running group - come and joing us for a gentle 5k every tuesday!). A large chunk of running has been jogging home.  My current job is the furthest west I've ever been and for the first time in 16 years I'm having to deal with the tube. On the way in to avoid the rush I go early and then exercise in the gym. On the way home if I don't have other plans I try and run home to avoid the squash.  So i've ended up doing lots of KM but that hasn't been reflected in faster times or good performances.  However I hope the solid groundwork will pay off next year - I'm attempting my first ultra - 100k round the isle of wight in May!  Fingers crossed...
