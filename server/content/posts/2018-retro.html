Life throws lots at you and both at the personal or macro level (such as global political changes or terminal illnesses for friends) which one has little control over. In this post I wanted to focus on some of the areas of my life I felt I did have can impact on the outcome. While learning and analysing mistakes is important I think it is equally valuable to celebrate and enjoy life when things work out - and I definitely err on the side of celebration here.

<h4>Year in numbers</h4>
<p>
 I monitor and track a few easily measurable parts of my life. It's interesting to see how my habits and focus changes over the years. Mainly I track books I've read and the exercise I do - I feel they are often an indicator of how well or busy other parts of life are.  These are the stats for this year:

Looking at those it looks like a pretty stellar year - read almost double the number of books as last year (which was pretty much a record year) ran 50% more than each of the previous two years (and the most I've ever run by a few KM) and written the most blog posts. But whats the story behind the numbers? Whats the one secret trick to reading more in a year?
</p>

<h4>The biggest impact on my year... working in the arts</h4>
<p>
  At the end of 2017 I joined the Royal Academy of Arts and for numerous reasons this has impacted huge areas of my life. Some of the impact is for mundane reasons - I now have a longer commute which has contributed to both running and reading more.  Other impact is more inspirational - working in the arts is an amazing environment and I've been inspired to learn more about arts and culture than at any other point in my life.  It's given me the urge to read and understand more, the confidence to expose myself to new experiences and has broken down mental barriers.
</p>

<h4>Running more doesn't necessarliy mean a good year of running</h4>
  <p>
  This year I ran the most that I've ever run! Previous best was 1,639km in 2012. So it must of been a great year of running?  Well - not so much. The year started off well but an achilles tendon from overdoing the running in March meant I was injured for the London Marathon. In May I was still recovering and posted my worst half marathon time at the Hackney Half (we run that each year with our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/techrunnersldn/" target="_blank">techrunners</a> running group). A large chunk of running has been jogging home.  My current job is the furthest west I've ever been and for the first time in 16 years I'm having to deal with the tube. Running is a good alternative! Injuries are sorted and I hope the solid groundwork will pay off next year - I'm attempting my first ultra - 100k round the Isle of Wight in the Spring!
  </p>
  <h4>I like getting told what to do</h4>
  <p>
   Yoga and swiming take up the rest of my exercise time. The highlight on the swimming was a swim trek holiday for the second year in a row. The trip this year was to the Montenegran fjords and the group swam about 4k a day in beautiful scenery.  Yoga I attempted to do self practice at the start of the year. After 11 years of regular practice I thought I'd be ok.  It was a disaster - I struggled to do anything more than the odd token session and I didn't improve in my technique.  I've gone back to paying for sessions and am much happier being told what to do by an expert. It was a good experiment and will think if I could of done anything differently to make it more of a success if I try it again.
  </p>

<h4>Book reading</h4>
<p>
This year I've almost doubled the amount of books I've read.  There's lots of reasons behind this but I think the main one is having a commute on a tube.  It's not very long but it means I get started with a book quickly.  On top of this I'm more settled in my career and also inspired by the environemnt around me. In this blog I've written a numberof times about having a more balanced reading list - this year has helped correct the overall balance over the years as 21 of the 35 books I read were by women.  Another big change from previous years is that I read something other than fiction!  The job has influenced that with lots of my books about artists or periods of art. My favourite book of the year was Walking Through Walls by Marina Abramovic.
</p>

<h4>Blogging and side projects</h4>
<p>
This year i've written the most blog posts. Again the new job is a factor of this - we're a small team and there aren't the same opportunities to discuss ideas as you get with a team of ~90 which we had at MOO.  I enjoy trying new things and find the process of writing blog posts a way to get the ideas sorted in my head as well as a focus to finish off side projects so I have something to write about.  On the side project the most fun one was <a href="https://view-from-the-ra.mikemjharris.com/" target="_blank">a view from the RA</a> - again related to the job - I get so many opportunities to take amazing pics from beautiful spaces and this collects the ones from the RA. Other side projects allowed me to tackle a bunch of interesting tech from GraphQL, Serverless, and Vuejs.
</p>
<h4>The year in a weekend</h4>
<p>
Being in the arts has inspired me to learn and do new things. Working in a area I never thought I would and doing a good job of it (accoriding to the feedback I've had so far) does wonders for your confidence and for trying things that I've had a mental block on. One of those is reading in a group and analysing what I am reading - I've generally read for myself and not wanted to join a book club.  This year through a random meeting on holiday I ended up joining the <a href="http://www.litsalon.co.uk/" target="_blank">London literary salon</a> on a weekend trip to St Ives to discuss Virginia Woolf's 'To The Lighthouse'.  This weekend brought together a whole bunch of my year - I got to hike, run and then swim in the sea.  St Ives has been a base for many artists over the years and I visited the Tate there and the Barbara Hepworth museum. Virginia herself was closely conencted to the visiual arts world with a friendship with Roger Fry and her sister Vanessa Bell attending the RA. It was a fantastic group of people and I loved delving into more depth into the book.  The whole weekend a joy and summed up my year - sport, art, reading, new people and new opportunities. Plus I took my chromebook along for a bit of tech on the train ride.
</p>

<h4>Year Summary</h4>
<p>
 A glorious year in terms of books, exercise and writing blogs/doing side projects.  I haven't touched on work related topics - I have plenty of other outlets for work related feedback - either at work, with my network of with my mentor and mentee.  The topics covered in this post aren't the entirety of life but they are telling metrics for me and ones that I have some imact on. I feel the fittest for a while and mentally I feel the most stiumlated in terms of breadth of topics tackled this year. Let's see how 2019 goes!
