  Microsoft are increasingly trying to make their products and tools appeal to a wider range developers.  A large chunk of coders out there work in a *nix environment (Linux or MACs) so Microsoft created <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">WSL</a> - Windows Subsystem for Linux. This allows users to run a linux like environment on Windows with little overhead. But how does it work in practice?  I had an initial go at trying it out in 2020 and have had another go in the past month. What's it like to setup and how does it compare to a native environment that I'm used to in my day to day work.

<h4>A brief history of my computers</h4>
<p>
  For the first ten years of my working life (~2002 - 2013) I worked in finance and worked only with Windows - but primarily for Excel rather than to code. With much horror I got a Macbook air when changing careers to coding - and then fell in love with Macs and couldn't imagine anything else. Macs lasted from 2013 - 2017.  In my first weeks at the Royal Academy of arts an unfortunate incident with an automatic tap and an open laptop bag meant I ruined my smart new Mac - there was a spare dell laptop so with he help of a team member who was a linux user I setup Ubunutu and have been a dedicated linux user since.

  My old 2013 home Mac has been little used and was due an upgrade - I opted for a refurbished new Windows Dell and created a dual boot with my usual Linux setup.  The linux setup does everything I need but I wanted to have a go a trying out Windows after such a long time - the blocker to using Windows all the time was whether I could do my day to day tasks.  WSL seemed to be the killer app that would mean that I could potentially use Windows and still code.
