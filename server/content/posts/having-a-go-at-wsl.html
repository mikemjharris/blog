  Microsoft are increasingly trying to make their products and tools appeal to a wider range developers.  A large chunk of coders out there work in a *nix environment (Linux or MACs) so Microsoft created <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">WSL</a> - Windows Subsystem for Linux. This allows users to run a linux like environment on Windows with little overhead. But how does it work in practice?  I had an initial go at trying it out in 2020 and have had another go in the past month. What's it like to setup and how does it compare to a native environment that I'm used to in my day to day work.

<h4>A brief history of my computers</h4>
<p>
  For the first ten years of my working life (~2002 - 2013) I worked in finance and worked only with Windows - but primarily for Excel rather than to code. With much horror I had to switch to Macs when changing careers to coding - obiously I then fell in love with Macs and couldn't imagine anything else. Macs lasted unitl 2017.  In my first weeks at the Royal Academy of Arts an unfortunate incident with an automatic tap and an open laptop bag meant I ruined my smart new Mac - there was a spare dell laptop so with he help of a team member who was a linux user I setup Ubunutu and have been a dedicated linux user since.

  My home laptops have followed a similar curve - for the majority of the last few years I've mainly been using the Macbook Air I got myself in 2013. I've had a few other gadgets: I've written in the past about coding on a chrome book;  last year I got a MS Surface go - although it's spent it's life attached to a stationary bike as a screen to run zwift (<a href="/pedaling-through-a-pandemic">pedaling through a pandemic</a>)

  i was due an upgrade on the old mac - i'd usually opt for the dell developer editions with Ubuntu already setup but the refurbished dell store had an excellent deal on a windows laptop - saving money (and saving the world?) i chose that and decided to both set it up as a dual boot with linux as well as giving wsl a proper go.

<h4>Why WSL?</h4>
<p>
   Why WSL? So one of the reasons for wallowing in nostalgia of my previous laptops was to give some context - I'm generally a linux user and for the main part have no issues with that setup.  Am always curious though as the odd application or device might work better on Windows/Mac.  WSL would give me the opportunity to try out windows again, benefit from that environment yet still be able to deal with the linux command line which is where I spend most of my day.

<h4>First go a WSL - 2020</h4>
<p>
   In 2020 I got a surface go - mainly to ride around in a virtual world but also to try it out as a beefed up portable computer to take the place of the dirt cheap chromebook I often use whout out and about. One of the things I tried out on it was WSL - at the time is was the first verison of WSL. There were definitely a few issues - I can't remember all the details but here's the notes I saved as to some of the problems I ran into:  k
