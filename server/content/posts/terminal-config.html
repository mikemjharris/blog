  It's been on my todo list for  a long time but I finally got round to putting some of the command line config into a repo.  The tipping point came because we got given a whole bunch of remote servers at work to build and run tooling and experiments on.  It was only when working in an uncustomised environment did I realise quite how much configuration I had setup and how much it improved my day to day work flow.

<h4>Easy to setup config</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/config">My config is up on github</a> and is installable from the command line using curl. Simple and easy to get up and running anywhere.
</p>

<h4>What is configured.</h4>

<p> 
  The main change for me over the past year has been to operate increasingly in vim. Having said that I have slightly quirky tooling setup - I use sublime for front-end work, IntelliJ for java and vim for pretty much everything else.  The one common factor is I use vim bindings for both the stand alone text editors. Vim is super customisable but I have started with a generic setup I found on the web and have expanded from there. 
</p>

<p>
  The other tool I have started to use more is tmux - there is a very basic config and I am still experimenting with different setups.  Having spent years switching tabs having toggelable panes in one window has been great.  On top of that tmux has been essential for running processes on remote servers. Having clearly named sessions to attach to also helps me remember where things live (I usually have one pane running the process and another in the main folder).

<h4>Aliasing</h4>
<p>
  Finally command line aliases speed up my day today work.  The three I use most are <code>hg</code>.  This stands for <code>history | grep</code>  which gives me a nudge on when I have used something previously.  The other two go hand in hand: <code>gb</code> and <code>gcb</code>.  The first lists all the local branches in a current repo in the order they were last checked out.  This is a huge help - I am often swapping between a number of branches when working on a couple of stories and code reviewing others code as well as running release processes.  I can remember what I was working on but can't remember the exact branch name.  listing the top 15 in order allows me to easily spot the one I was working on. There is a number alongside the list of branches and I can run <code>gcb $number</code> to checkout that branch! Super userful and helpful.
