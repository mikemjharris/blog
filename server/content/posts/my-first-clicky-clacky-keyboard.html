<h3>Hesitant</h3>
<p>
 There were so many reasons not to get a mechanical keyboard. I mean firstly the noise - how could I inflict that on my co workers.  Then the reputation - the stereotype clicky clacky keyboard user was the person I aspired to be. Finally ruining my exerience on a laptop - I love being able to work anywhere with minimal kit - just me and my trusty laptop. I thought I might love a new keyboard too much and never be able to tap out letters again on my spongy computer keys.
</p>

<h3>What changed</h3>
  <p>
    Pandmic world, working from home meant noone to disturb.  Maybe even the clicky clackiness would fill the empty conversational void.  Just me, talking to my keyboard. Oh the joy!
  </p>
  <p>
    The sterotype?  Well - there's so many people reclaiming the identiy of the typical mechanical keyboard user. Steroetypes maybe aren't the reality. I could try and own a keyboard and not change my personality at the same time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The laptop experience?  Still freaked out I'll never be able to type on a laptop ever again.

<h3>The Keyboard</h3>
  <p>
    Did a bit of googling and lacsidasical researching - then on a quiet pandemic day I needed the sweet dopamine rush of buying something. <a href="https://www.banggood.com/AKKO-3068-SP-Ocean-Star-68-Keys-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Cherry-Switch-Side-Printed-USB-2_0-Type-C-Wired-Gaming-Keyboard-p-1571192.html">This keyboard appeared in a search</a>. It looked super cool, wasnt too much. Click, click, click and it was on it's way.
  </p>

<p>
  It arrived, plugged in, pushed some keys and letters popped up on screen.  Excellent.  It's definitely clicky clacky. The typing experience? Excellent.  More travel with the keys, satisfying, enjoyable.  Wrists need to warm up to some heavy typing but once going my fingers were doing a very good riverdance impression.
</p>

<h3>The Keyboard - The Layout</h3>
<p>
  Went for one of the 60 - 65% keyboards as they most matched a laptop keyboard layout  - I've written before about <a href="/posts/me-and-my-keyboard">enjoying my fingers flying across the keys</a> so wanted to keep the layout experience very similar to what I'm used to (and don't want to lose).  I'd just be gaining all the extra travel and clickyness.
</p>

<p>
  The layout is pretty good but a few keys a bit different or missing from what I'm used to.  This meant I disappeared down a rabbit hole of tech to remap keys, ensure the remapping updated whenever the keyboard plugged in or the laptop went to sleep.  Am sure it should be easier but look at <a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/config/tree/master/conf/keyboard">all the ridiculousness I had to code.</a> to get things how I wanted.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Love the keybaord but not so much that I don't still enjoy the laptop.  It's loud and clicky and not sure if I can take it to the office and inflict it on people. Didn't quite believe all the faff of key remaping but that was pretty fun.  It's bit of plastic you push at and letters appear.  But that's what I do most of the day, all year round - and if that experience is a bit better then I'm a bit happier.
