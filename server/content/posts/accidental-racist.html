<p>
  Books - glorious, wonderful, mind changing, world creating, reality reflecting-distorting-enhancing books.  But what do the books I read say about me? In a previous post, <a href="/posts/accidental-sexist">accidental sexist</a>, I wrote about how the gender split of the authors I'd read showed that I wasn't as progressive or equal minded as I thought I was. Given the recent marches and Black Lives Matter protests I wanted to do a similar analysis and see if I was an accidental racist too.
</p>

<h3>Labeling the authors I read</h3>
<p>
  Labels can empower, unite and create solidarity but can also be misleading and restrictive. My aim in categorising authors is to help me improve the variety of books I read and see the world through different eyes. Some authors I imagine just want to be labelled as authors, others may be happier to be seen as a voice for their community. In trying to improve my outlook I appreciate that I am sat here with my white male privilege dolling out labels to those who may not want to be categorised but not doing so feels even worse.
</p>
<h3>Ethnically contrasting</h3>
<p>
  In analysing my reading habits the categories I should use: considering terms such as BAME, BME, Alternative Views, Ethnic Minority, Racially Distinct etc.  After lots of thoughts, reading articles such as <a href="https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/08/please-dont-call-me-bame-or-bme/">this</a> and chatting to friends I've settle on Ethnically Contrasting - nothing is perfect but this seemed to me to sum up the aim of what this analysis was looking at and provided a more neutral balanced viewpoint. Let's see what I think in a few years time when I have learnt more.
</p>
<h3>Why read</h3>
<p>
  There are so many reasons I read - for fun, a way to escape, to learn about me or the world around, to experience life as someone else, to live love and dream a different reality or fantasy.  Reading a more diverse set of authors is about my education and learning about their lived experiences but it is equally about enjoying new works, new books and discovering new talent that I can enjoy in the future. The joy of reading is the millions of different worlds out there to lose yourself in, the people you can become the lives you can share.

<h3>Accidental Racist - The stats</h3>
<p>
  Back in 2011 and 2012 I rediscovered reading break and wanted to read some modern classics - particularly the Great American Novel. As a result my reading habits were sexist and as you can see racist. Since then the balance of female to male authors has improved - the last four years I've read roughly double the amount of female authors as male (and a couple of books by authors who are non binary/trans). In the same time the percentage of ethnically contrasting books has increased.  In making myself think about gender inequality it also made me think about other forms of inequality and also helped me realise that my reading habits were blinkered.
</p>
<h3>Travelling mind and body</h3>
<p>
  The range of authors has also expanded the more I've travelled.  When visiting new countries I try to read books set in, or written by authors from that countries. Trips to Pakistan, Vietnam and Japan (among others) have helped expand both my mind and view on the world.  I've enjoyed the books and got more out of my travels.
</p>
<h3>Systemic issues</h3>
<p>
  Back in 2011 the system and my own habits restricted my outlook on the world. The system had labelled Roth, Updike, Bellow as the authors to read.   Since then I've changed and I think that the system has also changed a little - there are more lists and recommendations for underrepresented authors and more chances and opportunities out there. But these are small improvements and there is lot more to do.</p>
<h3>Time and focus</h3>
  <p>2015 was the first year I read more female authors than male. I read an article, focussed on changing my habits, congratulated my self, felt I'd solved that problem.  Thinking the problem was sorted I relaxed - the next year I read four times as many male authors as female - with effort I'd overcome systemic issues but they were still around. Without that focus I fitted back in to familiar habits. Change takes revolution and evolution and Persistence. It also takes time to balance out inequality - since 2016 I've read many more female authors - often twice as many.  Despite that since 2011 I've still read more male authors and can only imagine that the imbalance would be even worse if I had earlier records.
</p>
<p>
  In a similar way the Black Lives Matter protests are very visible and for a short time we are all concious of the issues. For me thinking, drafting and writing this post has helped keep those issues to the front of my mind the past few weeks. Whenever I finish a book and add it to my reading list I'll fill in the details around if they are an ethnically contrasting voice. While focussed on the authors I'm reading I hope this will keep issues surrounding race high up in my conciousness. Wishing to be better is great but finding new habits and processes to support that change can help make those wishes real and lasting.
</p>
<h3>The future</h3>
<p> I've read so many books the past few years - and my favourites have come from authors all across the ethnic spectrum (as have the books I've not liked!). I've loved the range of books although it's hard to describe the connection you get with some of the best books. The ones I engage and get enthralled with the most are often the toughest.
</p>
<p> But what's the right number of ethnically contrasting books to read?  In the UK roughly 15% of the population is ethically contrasting and in Hackney (where I live) it's around 50%. I am aiming to read at least 30% a year. The other 70% isn't just white British and American men.  It's a mix of all genders from across Europe and South America. Different analysis might put some of those authors as a ethnically contrasting - e.g. Sara Novic's story around the massacres and war in Yugoslavia - that voice and story is about race, ethnic cleansing and a different world to what I live in.  But as mentioned before labelling is tough, I've tried to be conservative. Even within a diverse set of authors - books by James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Jame Douglass and Ta-Nehisi Coates all tell very familiar and overlapping stories. The repetition and reinforcement is powerful but I also feel that I now have lots of knowledge of the story of slavery in America but am blind to the story of race in the UK.  I'm concious that getting to the end of the year and having a bunch of nice stats to show off is just a starting point - numbers can only reflect a small part of reality - it's up to me to look beyond the numbers and find the voices and stories I'll enjoy, learn, love, get hurt by, dance with, sing, wallow, feel terror, joy and pain. Stories that are both an escape from reality or a more real reality than my relatively comfortable privileged position.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Unsurprisingly that as a white man living in a systemically racist country my reading habits weren't balanced.  The good news is that thinking about any sort of inequality (in this case gender) helped me be more concious about all inequality.  While focusing on reading female authors I've also focussed on experiencing ethnically contrasting voices. Tracking and thinking about the race of the authors I read will help keep my reading habits broad.  The aim is also to keep these issues front of mind.  It's up to me to take that and ensure I also address all other aspects of my life.
</p>
<p>
  The number of books out there to read is intimidating but I don't let that defeat me - I just keep on reading and learning more - excited by whats next. In a similar vein the amount of change that is needed to sort out systemic inequality can feel overwhelming - we just need to keep on at it and tackle the next issue as it comes up.
