<p>
  Books - glorious wonderful mind changing world creating story telling.  But what do the books I read say about me? In a previous post, <a href="/posts/accidental-sexist">accidental sexist</a>, I wrote about how the list of authors I'd read showed that I wasn't as progressive or equal minded as I thought I was. Given the recent marches and Black Lives Matter protests I wanted to do a similar analysis and see if I was an accidental racist too.
</p>

<h3>Lables</h3>
<p>
  Labels can empower, unite and create solidarity but can also be misleading, restrictive and not reflective of the complexities and varaition of human existence. My aim in categorising authors is to help me improve the variety of books I read and see the world through different eyes. Some authors I imagine just want to be labelled as authors, others may be happier to be seen as a voice for their community. In trying to improve my outlook I appreciate that I am sat here with my white male privelige dolling out labels to those who may not want to be categorised.
</p>
<h3>Ethnically contrasting</h3>
<p>
  For this analysis and article I've debated the label I should use considering terms sucha as BAME, BME, Alternative Views, Ethnic Minority, Racially Distinct etc.  After lots of thougts, reading things such as <a href="https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/08/please-dont-call-me-bame-or-bme/">this article</a> and chatting to friends I've settle on Ethnically Contrasting - nothing is perfect but this seemed to me to sum up the aim of what this analysis was looking at and provided a more neutral viewpoint.
</p>
<h3>Why read</h3>
<p>
  There are so many reaons I read - sometimes a fun way to esacper reality, others to improve or learn about me or the world around, to experience life through someone elses hands, to live love and dream a difffernt reality or fantasty.  Reading from a more diverese set of authors is partyly about my education and learning about their lived experiences but it is equally about enjoying new works, new books and discovering new talent that I can enjoy in the future. Half the joy of reading is the millions of differnet worlds out there to lose yourself in and the chances are if the types of authors are different then the chances of discovering more new worlds is greadter.
  <p>
  My favourite types of book often hold up a mirror to the world and reflect both the beauty and ugliness of existence. I can love a book such as Beloved by Toni Morrison or God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy (two of my faourite ever reads) but also be deeply hurt and upset - both books at the core lay bare the pain, brutality and ugliness of parts of human nature.

<h3>The stats</h3>
<p>
  Back in 2011 and 2012 I rediscovered reading after a bit of a break and wanted to read some modern classics - particularly the Great American Novel. As a result my reading habits were sexist and as you can see racist. Since then the balance of female to male authors has improved - the last four years I've read roughly double the amount of female authors as male (and a couple of books by authors who are non binary/trans). In the same time the percentage of ethnically contrasting books has increased.  In making myself think about gender inequality it also made me think about other forms of inequality and also helped me realise that my reading habits were blinkered.  SO even without this blog post I'd already widened and made my reading habits more inclusive.
</p>
<h3>Systemic issues</h3>
<p>
  Back in 2011 the system and my own habits restricted my outlook on the world. The system had labelled Roth, Updike, Bellow as the authos to read.   Since then I've changed and I think that the system has changed a little - there are more lists and recommendations for underrepresented authors and more chances and opportunities out there. But these are small improvements and there is lot more to do.</p>
<h3>Time and focus</h3>
  <p>2015 was the first year I read more female authors than male. I read an article, focussed on changing my habits, congratulated my self, felt I'd solved that problem.  Thinking the problem was sorted I relaxed - the next year I read four times as many male authors as female - with focus I'd overcome systemic issues but they were still around and without that focus in 2016 meant I fitted back int  the familiar habits. Change takes reevolution and evolution and persistence. It also takes time to balance out inequality - since 2016 I've read many more female authors - often twice as many.  Despite that since 2011 I've still read more male authors and can only imagine that the imbalance would be even worse if I had earlier records.
</p>
<p>
  In a similar way the BLM protests are very visible and for a short time we are all concious of the issues. For me thinking, drafting and writing this post has helped keep those issues to the front of my mind the past few weeks. Whenever I finish a book and add it to my reading list I'll fill in the details around if they are an ethnically contrasting voice. While focussed on the authors I'm reading I hope this will keep issues surrounding race high up in my conciousness. Wishing to be better is great but finding new habits and processes to support that change can help make those wishes real and lasting.
</p>
<h3>The future</h3>
<p> I've read so many books the past few years - and my favourites have come from authors all across the ethnic spectrum (as have the books I've not liked!). I've loved the range of books although it's hard to describe the connection you get with some of the best books. The ones I engage and get enthrawled with the most are often the toughest.
</p>
<p> But what's the right number of ethnically contrasting books to read?  In the UK roughly 15% of the population is ehtically contrasting and in Hackney (where I live) it's around 50%. I am aiming to read at least 30% a year. The other 70% isn't just white british and us men.  It's a mix of women, men from across Europe and South America. Different analysis might put some of those authors as a ethnically contrasting - e.g. Sara Novic's story around the massacres and war in Yugoslavia - that voice and story is about race, ethnic cleansing and a different world to what I live in.  But as mentioned before labelling is tough, I've tried to be conservative. Even within more diversive authors books by James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Jame Douglass and Ta-Nehisi Coates all tell very familiar and overlapping stories. The repetition and reinfocement is powerful but I also feel that I now have lots of knowlegde of the story of slavery in America but am blind to the story of race in the UK.  I'm concious that getting to the end of the year and having a bunch of nice stats to show off is just a starting point - the real aim is to keep race inequality in my mind so that I am more concious about how I live life - not just in addressing who and what I read but also adressing issues in all parts of my lifeli
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Unsuprisingly that as a white man living in a systemically racist country my readin habits weren't balanced.  The good news is that thinking about any sort of inequality (in this case gender) helped me be more concious about all inequality.  While focusing on reading female authors I've also focussed on experiencing ethnically contrasting voices. Tracking and thinking about the race of the authors I read will help keep my reading habits broad.  The aim is also to keep these issues front of mind.  It's up to me to take that and ensure I also address all other aspects of my life.
</p>
<p>
  The number of books out there to read is intimidating but I don't let that defeat me - I just keep on reading and learning more - excited by whats next. In a similar vein the amount of chnage that is needed to sort out systemic inequality can feel overwhelming - we just need to keep on at it and tackle the next issue as it comes up.
</p>

Is that a reflection of the contrast to my fairly safe, privelidged postion in the world?
