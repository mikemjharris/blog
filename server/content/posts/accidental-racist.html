<p>
  Books - glorious wonderful mind changing world creating story telling.  But what do the books I read say about me? In a previous post, <a href="/posts/accidental-sexist">accidental sexist</a>, I wrote about how the list of authors I'd read suggested that I wasn't as progressive or equal opprotunity minded as I thought I was. Given the recent marches and Black Lives Matter protests I wanted to do a similar analysis and see if I was (at best) an accidental racist.

<h3>Gender, Race and Labels</h3>
<p>
  Labels can empower, unite and create solidarity but can also be misleading, restrictive and not reflective of the complexities and varaition of human existence. I am learning more about race and gender - my thoughts on boths have changed over the past few years especially as I read more. My aim in categorising authores is to help me improve the variety of books I read and see the world through different eyes. I feel a James Baldwin, a Toni Morrison, Jame Douglass, Ta-Nehisi Coates would happily acknowlege that their written voice is about race and inequality.  I am sure there are other writers whose only label they want is to be labelled a writer.In trying to improve my outlook I appreciate that I am sat here with my white male privelige dolling out labels to those who may not want to be categorised - in analysing my reading list I have labelled the books privately and ony show the total stats per year to give me an idea of the variety of views I am experiecing.

<h3>Ethnically contrasting</h3>
<p>
  The term I've used to distinguish different voices in the writers of books is ethnically contrasting. I'm still learing about race and the terms used - I've talked and listened to friends and colleagues, watched programs, plays, films and read books and articles. For this analysis and article I've switched the label I've used numerous times. Others I've considered include BAME, BME, Alternative Views, Ethnic Minority, Racially Distinct etc.  I've settle on Ethnically Contrasting - nothing is perfect but this seemed to me to sum up the aim of what this analysis was looking at. Roughly speaking anyone from a Black, Asian Middle East (BAME) (I found <a href="https://civilservice.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/08/please-dont-call-me-bame-or-bme/">this article</a> very interesting) has an ethnically contrasting voice to me.
