  Glancing out of the shed window I see the light layer of snow on the ground, sparkling despite the darkness of the evening. A voice in my ear brings my focus back to the screen in front of me. "Ok - coming off in 10 seconds. 5..4....3...."  It's my turn at the front - I grasp the handlbars firmly, pump my legs and pedal harder.  My cycling avatar on screen surges forward. "Ok!" I say into my headset "I'll take the next minute". Sweat dripping over my eyes I spin faster on stationary bike, settling in for 60secs of effort.

<h3>Watt bike?</h3>
<p>
  Back in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic a friend who runs a cycle studio was renting out one his stationary bike - with restrictions iminent I jumped at the opportunity.  Over the next few weeks I discovered the online virtual world of zwift. Thre were free rides - where one got to enjoy the rare feeling of being an anonymous person in a crowd - There was the thrill of racing in one off events and also managed to have meetups with friends from across the world for virtual rides and chats. I was also the annoying person cycling through meetings - although in my defence only occasioanlly and where I was a passive participent</p>

  With the summer, warm weather and reduced restrictions the lure of the real world meant I only managed the odd ride.  Those rides were great though - not having to worry about traffic, roads, steering - just having a focussed bit of workout time.  Most of my exercise time was spent running or in the water as detailed in a previous post <a href="/posts/paddling-through-a-pandemic.html">paddling through a pandemic</a>

<h3>Dark cold nights of Winter</h3>
<p>
  With winter coming, dark nights and more restrictions the bike really came into it's own although I still had to motivate myself to ride which often was tough with the warped world of lockdowns. That was until I got a call from my friend who had rented me the bike - would I like to join their team and race as part of an online weekly league? Excited to try something new and to have a commitement outside of work during my week I signed up to be part of the Southhampton Tri Club B team racing in the C category of the <a href="https://www.wtrl.racing/about.php">wtrl racing league</a> - all of which meant absolutely nothing to me.

<h3>Free for all</h3>
<p>
  The league consisted of two types of events.  The first event I joined for was free for all race where everyone was in a mass start. There was plenty of tech to setup from signing up to new websites, linking those to Zwift and signing up to discord so I could chat to the rest of the team. The first race was tough and exilerating - it was fun to have an event to look forward to, some new people to chat to before and after (and to heavy breathe at during the event) and the negotiating racing in a big pack, being spat out the back and working with other riders was a new experience.
</p>
<h3>Team Time Trial</h3>
<p>
 A week later I joined for a Team Time Trial event. Here teams of up to six riders set off every 30s.  The overall time of the team is based on the fourth person over the line so everyone has to work together to get the best overall time for the team. The physics in Zwift are fantastic - when sat close behind other riders the power needed to keep up is about 20% less.  Within the group everyone takes a turn at the front to put in an extra effort and keep up the speed, they then roll off and take a break in the pack until it's their turn again.
</p>
<p>
  It sounds reasonably straight forward but there was so much more to it - the setup means that you can have a range of different abilities and everyone takes different amounts of time at the front.  Lots of talking, comparing energy levels and if the team was together.  Hills would cause the group to break up and more experienced riders would drop back to pull the stragglers back into the group.  When dropping off the front you needed to put a burst of energy in before you rolled off the back. As the B team we tried as much as possible to keep all our riders togetehr - while we wanted to be competitive this was also a fun event for the whole team. There would be the odd person who dropped off either completely exhaused or for technical reasons.
</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>
  Tuesday evenings became a highight of my week and I also joined in on races on Thursdays where there were more riders per team.  The make up each week changed and there was such a different feel - some weeks we rotated at the front like clockwork, some weeks we had a plan before, others made it up as we went, sometimes we'd be a split group every few mins others a solid line of riders.  I got to get a feel for how others cycled and how the event would go.  Every route was different and got more into understanding how the league worked.  In the new year a new season started and we'd progressed up a division.  The races are large - about 900 teams are racing across all the divisions.  Tuesdays we were a group of guys but our thursday ride was a mix and a wider range of ability.

<h3>The real wrol</h3>






  There are two types of race in the league - the first one I joined was similar to other zift races - everyone gathers at the start, there's a sprint start and then everyones battling each other.  The races take anything from 40min to an hour and by then you are a sweaty exhausted mess.  The benefit from racing anonymously was that we got to chat on discord before - the more experienced riders giving tips and advice as well as having a good chat. During the race there's generally jsut a few grunts and groans but sometimes some chatter about how everyone's doing and a bit of swearing when a hill looms.  Post race and with the warm glow of finishing we'd chat about how people found it and our results.  While remote, on a screen and only chatting on headphones it added much more than the normal zwift. Chatting to andoms or fairly new aquintences has been something missign from 2020 with most communication via slack and zoom at work or via phone to friends and family

</p>
<h3>Team Time Trial</h3>A
<p>The best event though is the team time trial. Teams of up to 6 riders set off every 30s. The overall time for the team is the fouth person across the line - so the setup rewards team work. Zwift does an excellent job of modelling the physics so when sat in the
