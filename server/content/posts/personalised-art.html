   I recently got a new twitter banner courtesy of the talented <a href="https://twitter.com/stephoodle">Steph</a>. This is a post to show off that work (which I am super happy with)as well as to share a few tips for anyone commissioning work done for them - whether that be something as obviously creative as this banner or something more functional such as a website. Having been on both sides of the client / creator divide I wanted to give some pointers that I think help make the whole process go smoothly as well as maximising the chance that you get what you want.

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>- Do your research</li>
  <li>- Communicate clearly</li>
  <li>- Be a good person (aka Don't be an asshole)</li>
</ul>

  In case all you were here for is the result - here it is - looking good!  Also can see it in action <a href="www.twitter.com/mikemjharris">on my twitter homepage</a>.

Here's the original pic I sent in. For various reasons we have a number of deckchairs at work (for wimbledon we had our own homage to murray mound with deckchairs and fak grass setup infront of large screens showing the tennis). Got a friendly co worker to snap a pic of me hard at work.
