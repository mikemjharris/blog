  I recently got a new twitter banner courtesy of the talented <a href="https://twitter.com/stephoodle">Steph</a>.  In this post I wanted so show off her work and also go through some of the steps in getting to this stage.  In any situation where there is personalised work being created, whether that's a website, a piece of art or say an extension the success and happiness of the project relies upon a commitment to clear and regular communication parties. This post shares a few of my tips.
