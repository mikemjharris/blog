<p>
   I recently got a new twitter banner courtesy of the talented <a href="https://twitter.com/stephoodle">Steph</a>. This is a post to show off that work (which I am super happy with)as well as to share a few tips for anyone commissioning work done for them - whether that be something as obviously creative as this banner or something more functional such as a website. Having been on both sides of the client / creator divide I wanted to give some pointers that I think help make the whole process go smoothly as well as maximising the chance that you get what you want.

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>- Do your research</li>
  <li>- Communicate clearly</li>
  <li>- Be a good person (aka Don't be an asshole)</li>
</ul>
