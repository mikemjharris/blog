  A friend posted some pics on twitter of an artistic impression of her playing computer games. I loved it, wanted something similar and a month later I was the proud owner of a piece of art depicting me sat on a deckchair with my computer.  This was courtesy of the talented <a href="https://twitter.com/stephoodle" target="_blank">Steph</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  This is a post to show off that work as well as to share a few tips for anyone commissioning work done for them - whether that be something as obviously creative as a piece of art through to something more functional such as a website. Having been on both sides of the client / creator divide I wanted to give some pointers that I think help make the whole process go smoothly as well as maximising the chance that you get what you want.  
</p>

<h3>TLDR</h3>
<ul>
  <li>- Do your research</li>
  <li>- Communicate clearly</li>
  <li>- Be a good person (aka Don't be an asshole)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In case all you were here for is the result - here it is - looking good! It is also on show as my new <a href="www.twitter.com/mikemjharris" target="_blank">on my twitter banner</a>.

<h3>Do your research</h3>
<p>
To get the best results in most things in life do some research. In this case I'd already seen my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/angelsk" target="_blank">Jo's</a> commissioned piece of art.  I asked her where she had got it done and ended up in contact with Steph on twitter and checking out <a href="http://stephoodle.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">her tumblr</a>. I liked what I saw and sat down and had a think of what I wanted.  Taking a bit of time to get a firm outline of what you want will really help you get that message across. 
</p>
<p>
 There are other factors too - time and money.  There was no rush in time from my end but this can often be a huge part of any negotiation so think your timeline through properly.  Then the big one - money.  In this case I was well prepared - having been in the web design business I have a reasonably good idea of some of the hidden complexity of work as well as a rough idea of how much something like this should cost. The chances are if you don't understand the process you will massively understate the complexity and time for what to you on the surface might seem simple. 
 </p>

 <h3>Communicate clearly</h3>
 <p>
  There will always be more questions after you have done your research.  My next steps were to send a high level outline of what I wanted to Steph referencing pieces from her portfolio I liked and some inspiration from the internet. I mentioned time wasn't an issue and asked politely about cost as well as what else she would need from me.  Be aware that however well you think you have outlined your idea there will always be questions.  You are talking to an expert and they know their process and mind better than you so will often need other pointers and questions. In my case Steph asked for some pics (see Appendix below) as well as getting me add specific details of what I wanted in the finished piece.  She also asked some questions such as what sort of background I wanted.  Her rate was right around what I was expecting and she clearly communicated that it needed to be paid upfront. Paypal sprang into action and I transferred the money immediately. 
 </p>
 <p>
  A few weeks later my commission was done!  Having spent the time to do my research and had a good two way communication with Steph the result was exactly what I wanted (actually have to admit it was even better than expected!). I didn't want any changes but did ask Steph to add an additional image with slightly different dimensions.  She also spotted that when it was up on my twitter banner that she could make some improvements to the resolution.  A day later the additional requests were done! Super happy!
 </p>

 <h3>Don't be an Asshole</h3>
 <p>
 I mean this is a given really for anything in life, in this case here are some examples of what I've seen of experienced over the years.  I think the biggest issue creative people have is people not wanting to pay for work.  This can be a wide range of reasons from not understanding the work is needed, not appreciating the time and effort over the years to learn skills, not realising that this is someone's job - not just a bit of fun on the side. Exposure isn't money so don't offer exposure. Do your research beforehand and have an idea of what you might be expected to pay. If the quote is way above your reach then that's fine - no none is forcing you to  pay it - just politely and respectively decline. Sure you can negotiate a bit if you want but what is the price of creativity?  Creative people make the world a better and more beautiful place - why chisel away and try and save a few quid?  As a point of reference <a href="https://twitter.com/stephoodle/status/894857824790093825" target="_blank">here's Steph's prices: </a>.
 </p>
 <p>
  Apart from money be polite and helpful in all your communications.  Steph and I did all our chatting over twitter DM - if you rush and are rude that chances of communicating what you want are greatly reduced.
 </p>
 <p>>
  Finally accept that you are taking a risk and the finished product might not be 100% what you wanted.  Understand that something creative isn't churning out Ikea furniture from the assembly line. Trust that the artist probably knows more than you on what goes together. If you aren't happy, be polite, go back with specific requests and work together to make it better. You probably didn't follow the above steps fully. If you still don't get something perfect then smile, and move on.  Life is a big wonderful ball of mess and things sometimes just don't work out. Don't ask for your money back - this in a investment of them and in your understanding.

   Hope those tips help. Am sure there other things to consider but I reckon if you stick to those three tips you'll be alright.  I was thrilled with my final piece.  It's on my twitter profile and business cards.  In addition it was a good learning experience and I enjoyed being on the client side of the fence having been on the creative side usually. 


I took some specific examples from Steph's work as well as some inspiration from the internet and sent over a what I was looking for as well as some questions around timing and cost.

<h3>Sent picture</h3>

Here's the original pic I sent in. For various reasons we have a number of deckchairs at work (for Wimbledon we had our own homage to Murray mound with deckchairs and fake grass setup in front of large screens showing the tennis). Got a friendly co worker to snap a pic of me hard at work.
