<p>Google provides an excellent tool called lighthouse that can be used for "for improving the quality of web pages." I've manually run the tool in the past but wanted to run an automated performance and quality review on the main sites I maintain </p>

<h4>What is lighthouse</h4>

<p>There are excellent <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank"></a>docs</a> on the google website. In short the tool "audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.".  You can access the tool by opening up Dev Tools, selecting the audit tab and running the audit. At the end you get scores across a number of areas.  You can see an example for this blog in the pic below</p>

<h4>The stats</h4>

<p>As you can see the major areas are Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.  There's an additional marker for how whether the site classifies as a Progressive Web App. My blog is in the green (above 90) for all the metircs. It was doing pretty well before but I knew I was writing this blog post so updated a number of areas to make sure it looked as impressive as possible.</p>

<h4>Automating via the CLI</h4>
<p>
 Life's too busy to remeber to run ad hoc reports.  To ensure I had the numbers easily to hand I wanted to automate the process of running the report and potentially alerting me if the numbers dropped. Lighthouse has a CLI which allows yous to run the tests from the command line. The<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse" target="_blank">readme on github</a> is pretty comprehensive. There are plenty of options including running the tests headless (i.e. without a visible browser) which means that one can run it on a remote server.
</p>
<h4>Docker it up</h4>
<p>
  My main server that runs all my websites runs everything in docker containers and I wanted to use docker to run the lighthouse CLI. After a quick google I found this <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/justinribeiro/lighthouse/" target="_blank">justing ribeiro's</a> docker container and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/femtopixel/google-lighthouse/" taget="_blank">another</a>. However for both I had a number of issues getting chrome to run and to get a proper report using the commands given.  After much trial and error I worked out that I needed the '--no-sandbox' chrome flag.  As part of my investigation I'd made <a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/dockerfiles/blob/master/lighthouse/Dockerfile" target="_blank">my own dockerfile</a> - largely based on justin's with a few tweaks. I stuck with this as I'd have control over it in the future and it also had a later version of lighthouse than the image pulled from docker hub.</p>
<h4>The setup</h4>
<p>
  The setup involved a couple of cron jobs (<a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/infrastructure/blob/eb6348c43bc9ea2ca7019242bf47dff310c8ee27/crontab/crontab-jobs.txt">setup </a> from my infra repo) to run HTML and JSON reports for this blog and my main www site every morning. The folder is sylinked to my main website director so all the reports are accessible online. </p>

<h4>Conclsion</h4>
<p>
  Getting lighthouse to run was fairly straighforward due to the excellent google docs.  The main time sink was getting docker to run properly. Now the rerports are generated automatically I can easily access them without having to be at the desktop and manually running the report. If this was an important business critical site I could setup alerts around when the metrics change - for my own personal projects I prefer a bit of peace and quiet over worrying too much about the state of my projects.
