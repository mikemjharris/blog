<p>Google provides an excellent tool called lighthouse that can be used for "for improving the quality of web pages." I've manually run the tool in the past but wanted to run an automated performance and quality review on the main sites I maintain </p>

<h4>What is lighthouse</h4>

<p>There are excellent <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank"></a>docs</a> on the google website. In short the tool "audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, and more.".  You can access the tool by opening up Dev Tools, selecting the audit tab and running the audit.

<p>As you can see the major areas are Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO.  There's an additional marker for how whether the site classifies as a Progressive Web App. As you can see this site is scoring close to 100 for all four categories and clasifies as a progressive Web App.  It's a fairly lmimited in terms of complexity and most corporate sites will have much lower numbers.  You can have little run the tool yourself against any site and see how they are doing.  For example twitter ranges from 26 for performance through to a max of 90 for SEO. It's hard in a bigger organisation - I've checked all the sites I've professionally worked on and the numbers are worse than twitter - there are many comprimises and other priorities for an orgnasation. However targeting higher numbers should be key. The only way to push for improvements is to ensure that the numbers are being looked at.  Manually running ad hoc reports wont help with obeservability which is why I wanted to look into automating the process.</p>

<h4>Lighthouse CLI</h4>
<p>Lighthouse has a CLI which allows yous to run the tests from the command line. The<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse" target="_blank">readme on github</a> is pretty comprehensive. There are plenty of options including running the tests headless (i.e. without a visible browser) which means that   <a
