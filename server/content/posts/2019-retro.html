<h1>TODO - change last years data!!!!</h1>
<p>
  How was my 2019?  Life is way more complex and wonderful than a set of four metrics but in tracking a few things I get a pretty good idea how my year has gone. If you monitor more than these four things then you are a data obsessive with no understanding of the beauty of life. If you aren't at least tracking these metrics then what are you doing - you're leaving your whole world to misunderstood randomness.  Obviously It is clear these are the four things to look at to see how life is.

<p>
  Pretty good year overall - roughly same number of books read, loads more KM run, less swimming and fewer blog posts but a whole bunch more bending.  But a higher number for each of thses isn't always a good thing - that's a hell of a lot more running this year but is that healthy? Were personal crisese that I self medicated with obsessive excersie?  Here's look into the story behind the numbers...
</p>


<h4>Running more doesn't necessarily mean a good year of running</h4>
  <p>
    Last year I ran the most I'd ever run.  This year I ran 50% more than last year! The main reason was signing up to my first ever ultra with a couple of friends.  We ran round the Isle of Wight (106km) one Saturday in May.  Lots of ways to train for long races but I went for the option of running more but at lower intensity. Fitted this into my week mainly by doing a few more commute runs and slightly longer weekend runs. Also while taking some time off after big runs I made sure I got back into at least low level training quicker than previous years. Am getting older and find having an extended fallow period makes getting back into training pretty tough.
  </p>
  <p>
     Loved the ultra and have really loved the trail running community. Post IOW ran two more ultras (50k in Tring in summer and 50k in Surrey hills in Dec). In addition ran the London marathon as part of my training and did Hackney half with techrunners (and suprised myself with my fastest time on that course despite lack of speed training).  Techrunners I stepped back in the summer - being the main person responsible for organising the weekly runs is quite tough over a long time and I needed a breather.
     </p>
     <p>
       Next year I'm moving jobs and will have a super short commute.  Whilst I can definitely make the run home longer it's hard to push and do those extra KM on days when you are tired.  I expect next year to run less but am planning on doing more high quality runs - hoping to join some track and hill training sessions. Main aim of the year is to run a London marathon qualifying time in Milton Keynes marathon in may and then run a couple of ultra trail runs.
</p>

  <h4>Swimmign & Yoga</h4>
  <p>
    Least amount of swming this year - mainly because I didn't do a SwimTrek holiday.  Planning on doing one next year and my new office is near the Lido so expect much more swimming next year.  This year swam the 1 mile Looe island swim - it's where my Grandma lives and meant a lot to do a big swim in the sea where we played around as kids. Next year planning on the same one and looking at some longer distance ones too.
  </p>
  <p>
    After experimenting with self pracitce a previous year I'm back in the swing of classes - mainly at Hot Pod Yoga in hackney. Have made sure I had time to do the yoga to balance the extra running I do - generally when I run but don't do yoga I get injured - this year has been fine.
    </p>

    <p>
       January I have a month off and am going to be completing my 200 hour yoga teacher training in Bali.  Super excited as has been a goal of mine to do for a while now and luckily managed to organise time off between jobs to finally get to do it.  Expect next years yoga numbers to be through the roof!
    </p>

<h4>Book reading</h4>
<p>
  Roughly the same number of books read as the previous year. Continued to ensure I read a balanced set of authors - I track gender but also try and make sure that I read authors from all over the world and with different voices and backgrounds.  On the gender fron read XX by females, YY male and (knowingly) read my first book by a non binary author. Highlights?  So many but probably Kintu, Mrs Palfrey and the Claremont, Pulp, Beloved and Winter. Full list of books I read this year <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com">here</a>
</p>

<h4>Blogging and side projects</h4>
<p>
   Fewer blog posts this year. Try and write soemthing everyother month which I have achieved.  Side projects finished off the books project (link in previous paragraph), created automated lighthouse testing for this blog and for my main website, tiedied up all the ad hoc infrastrucutre that all my side projects used and put it in source control. This blog continues to be a project in development and added new functionality by adding tags.  Did one tech talk this year at the tessitura conference and went to one other conference - Lead Dev in berlin.
</p>
<h4>Other</h4>
<p>
  Similarly to last year this year has been hugely impacted by working at the RA and being in the arts world. Knowing I probably wouldn't be in this world forever have made the most of my pass by visiting a huge amount of galleries and exhibitions. The benefit of free entry is that I don't feel obliged to stay in an exhibiton I don't enjoy and also means I try out others I would not otherwise of done.  For example popped into Van Gogh and britain in Tate britain - didn't engage with it much so was finished in a matter of minutes so decided to pop into Frank Bowling's exhibiton which was maginificient and delightful and in my top exhibitons for the year.  That would be rounded out by the RA's Gormley exhbiiton and Lee Herring at Tate Liverpool.
</p>
<p>
   Lots of topics have come up again and again and wrote a bit about Bauhas and architecutre in this post.  But on top of that others such as Ruskin and William morris have popped up againa nd again - have got biographies on both for Christmas to read up a bit more next year.


<h4>Work</h4>
<p>
  After a glorious couple of years at the RA i'm moving on.  Lots of reasons including a new interesting challenge, more money, shorter commute (walk to work!) among others.  The timing was also right - we finished off the main implementation of a new ticketing, membership and CRM system. There are a couple of other interesting projects here and I didn't want to start those if I wasn't going to stick around and see them through.  Delightled to have helped the team here find a replacement for me.
</p>
<h4>Year Summary</h4>
<p>
  Overall excellent year - these are the areas I've focussed on.  Being able to do this much sport and other things is a reflection that other parts of life aren't too tough.  Myself nor any close friends or family have had any major illnesses.  Generally things are pretty stable and  I appreciate am in a privelliged position.  Managed to do a good jov of keeping up with friends - some going through tough times and always good to support and help them as the big wheel of life keeps turning.
