<h1>TODO - change last years data!!!!</h1>
<p>
  How was my 2019?  Life is way more complex and wonderful than a set of four metrics but in tracking a few things I get a pretty good idea how my year has gone. If you monitor more than these four things then you are a data obsessive with no understanding of the beauty of life. If you aren't at least tracking these metrics then what are you doing - you're leaving your whole world to misunderstood randomness.  Obviously It is clear these are the four things to look at to see how life is.

<p>
  Pretty good year overall - roughly same number of books read, loads more KM run, less swimming and fewer blog posts but a whole bunch more bending.  But a higher number for each of thses isn't always a good thing - that's a hell of a lot more running this year but is that healthy? Were personal crisese that I self medicated with obsessive excersie?  Here's look into the story behind the numbers...
</p>


<h4>Running more doesn't necessarily mean a good year of running</h4>
  <p>
    Last year I ran the most I'd ever run.  This year I ran 50% more than last year! The main reason was signing up to my first ever ultra with a couple of friends.  We ran round the Isle of Wight (106km) one Saturday in May.  Lots of ways to train for long races but I went for the option of running more but at lower intensity. Fitted this into my week mainly by doing a few more commute runs and slightly longer weekend runs. Also while taking some time off after big runs I made sure I got back into at least low level training quicker than previous years. Am getting older and find having an extended fallow period makes getting back into training pretty tough.
  </p>
  <p>
     Loved the ultra and have really loved the trail running community. Post IOW ran two more ultras (50k in Tring in summer and 50k in Surrey hills in Dec). In addition ran the London marathon as part of my training and did Hackney half with techrunners (and suprised myself with my fastest time on that course despite lack of speed training).  Techrunners I stepped back in the summer - being the main person responsible for organising the weekly runs is quite tough over a long time and I needed a breather.
     </p>
     <p>
       Next year I'm moving jobs and will have a super short commute.  Whilst I can definitely make the run home longer it's hard to push and do those extra KM on days when you are tired.  I expect next year to run less but am planning on doing more high quality runs - hoping to join some track and hill training sessions. Main aim of the year is to run a London marathon qualifying time in Milton Keynes marathon in may and then run a couple of ultra trail runs.
</p>

  <h4>I like getting told what to do</h4>
  <p>
  Yoga and swimming take up the rest of my exercise time. The highlight on the swimming was a swim trek holiday for the second year in a row. The trip this year was to the Montenegrin fjords and the group swam about 4k a day in beautiful scenery.</p><p>  Yoga I attempted to do self practice at the start of the year. After 11 years of regular practice I thought I'd be OK.  It was a disaster - I struggled to do anything more than the odd token session and I didn't improve in my technique.  I've gone back to paying for sessions and am much happier being told what to do by an expert. It was a good experiment and will think if I could of done anything differently to make it more of a success if I try it again. On the upside I've progressed on my goal of achieving a handstand - I attended a number of workshops and had a 1-1 session. See <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1078716758159228928" target="_blank">this twitter post</a> for a taster.
  </p>

<h4>Book reading</h4>
<p>
This year I've almost doubled the amount of books I've read.  There's lots of reasons behind this but I think the main one is having a commute on a tube.  It's not very long but it means I get started with a book quickly.  On top of this I'm more settled in my career and also inspired by the environment around me. </p><p>In this blog I've written a number of times about having a more balanced reading list - this year has helped correct the overall balance over the years as 21 of the 34 books I read were by women.  Another big change from previous years is that I read something other than fiction!  The job has influenced that with lots of my books about artists or periods of art. My favourite book of the year was Walking Through Walls by Marina Abramovic and you can access the full list at <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com/" target="_blank">books.mikemjharris.com</a>.
</p>

<h4>Blogging and side projects</h4>
<p>
This year I've written the most blog posts. Again the new job is a factor of this - we're a small team and there aren't the same opportunities to discuss ideas as you get with a team of ~90 which we had at MOO.  I enjoy trying new things and find the process of writing blog posts a way to get the ideas sorted in my head as well as a focus to finish off side projects.</p><p>  On the side project front the most fun one was <a href="https://view-from-the-ra.mikemjharris.com/" target="_blank">a view from the RA</a> - again related to the job - I get so many opportunities to take amazing pics from beautiful spaces and this collects the ones from the RA. </p><p>Other side projects allowed me to tackle a bunch of interesting tech from GraphQL, Serverless, and Vuejs. Favourite blog post and side project combined: I most enjoyed purchasing, setting up and coding on my chromebook which I wrote about <a href="https://blog.mikemjharris.com/posts/coding-with-a-chromebook" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<h4>The year in a weekend</h4>
<p>
Being in the arts has inspired me to learn and do new things. Working in an area I never thought I would and doing a good job of it (according to the feedback I've had so far) does wonders for your confidence and for trying things that I've had a mental block on. One of those is reading in a group and analysing a books content and meaning - I've generally read for myself and not wanted to join a book club.  This year through a random meeting on holiday I ended up joining the <a href="http://www.litsalon.co.uk/" target="_blank">London literary salon</a> on a weekend trip to St Ives to discuss Virginia Woolf's 'To The Lighthouse'.  This weekend brought together a whole bunch of my year - I got to hike, run and then swim in the sea.  St Ives has been a base for many artists over the years and I visited the Tate and the Barbara Hepworth museum. Virginia herself was closely connected to the visual arts world with a friendship with Roger Fry and her sister Vanessa Bell attending the RA. It was a fantastic group of people and I loved delving into more depth into the book.  The whole weekend was a joy and summed up my year - sport, art, reading, new people and new opportunities. Plus I took my chromebook along for a bit of tech on the train ride.
</p>

<h4>Year Summary</h4>
<p>
A glorious year in terms of books, exercise and writing blogs/doing side projects.  I haven't touched on work topics - I have plenty of other outlets for professional related feedback - either at work, with my network of with my mentor and mentee.  The topics covered in this post aren't the entirety of life but they are telling metrics for me and ones that I have some impact on. Deeper and existential angst I prefer to save for professional therapy.</p>
<p>
Overall I feel the fittest for a while. Mentally I feel stretched in a huge range of directions and this has been an intellectual Annus Mirablis. Let's see how 2019 goes!
</p>
<h4>Appendix - Resolutions</h4>
<p>
I did <a href="https://blog.mikemjharris.com/posts/2018-resolutions" target="_blank">write</a> some new years resolutions at the start of the year, succeeded to a certain degree in all of them.  However I found that they didn't feel like a significant part of the year - I set myself a whole range of goals from daily, weekly to multi year and have lots of ways of managing and progressing along those.  It was fun to write the New Years resolutions, I'll probably set some this year but wont write about them as they don't feel any more special than the rest of life.</p>
