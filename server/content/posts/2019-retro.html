<p>
  How was my 2019?  Life is way more complex and wonderful than a set of four metrics but in tracking a few things I get a pretty good idea how my year has gone.

<p>
  Pretty good year overall - roughly same number of books read, loads more running and yoga but less swimming and fewer blog posts. More isn't always a good thing - that amount of running seems a bit obsessive - was it a healthy amount of running or was it running away from problems? Here's how I interpreted the numbers (with the advantage of knowing how life wrapped itself amongst these stats tempered by the fuzzy goggles of self awareness)
</p>

<h4>Running more doesn't necessarily mean a good year of running</h4>
<p>
  Last year I ran the most I'd ever run.  This year I ran 50% more than last year! The main reason was signing up to my first ever ultra (106km round the Isle of Wight) with a couple of friends. Training consisted of lots of low intensity sessions which I fitted in by mainly running a few more legs of the commute. The benefit of this was that my social life wasn't particularly impacted.
</p>
<p>
   The ultra went really well and have loved the trail running community. Ran two more 50k ultras as well as using the London marathon as part of my training and racing in the Hackney half with techrunners. Over the summer I reduced my commitment with Techrunners - being the main person responsible for organising the weekly runs is quite tough over a long time and I needed a breather. Thanks to those who've helped out with making sure the runs still happen!
</p>
<p>
 Next year I have a shorted commute so expect to do less running. Main aim is to run a London qualifying time at the Milton Keynes Marathon and then fit in a few trail runs.

<h4>Swimming & Yoga</h4>
<p>
  No Swim Trek holiday this year which translated into the least amount for swimming for a few years.
 Did manage to complete the Looe island swim - was a special event for me as it's where my Grandma lives and where we played in the sea as kids. Next year planning on the same one and looking at some longer distance ones too so probably more swimming next year.
</p>
<p>
  After experimenting with yoga self practice a previous year I'm back in the swing of classes - mainly at Hot Pod Yoga in Hackney. Have made sure I had time to do the yoga to balance the extra running.
</p>

<p>
  This January I have a month off and am going to be completing my 200 hour yoga teacher training in Bali.  Super excited as has been a goal of mine to do for a while now and luckily managed to organise time off between jobs to finally get to do it.  Expect next years yoga numbers to be through the roof!
</p>

<h4>Book reading</h4>
<p>
  Roughly the same number of books read as the previous year. Continued to ensure I read a balanced set of authors. This year number of books written by females was XX, males YY and also (knowingly) read my first book by a non binary author. Highlights?  So many but probably Kintu, Mrs Palfrey and the Claremont, Pulp, Beloved and Winter. <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com">Here's the full list of books I read this year</a>.
</p>

<h4>Blogging and side projects</h4>
<p>
  Fewer blog posts this year but above a post every other month. Side projects: I finished off the books project, setup automated lighthouse testing and added all the infrastructure config around my personal projects to github.
</p>
<h4>The art world</h4>
<p>
  Similarly to last year this year has been hugely impacted by working at the RA. Knowing I probably wouldn't be in the traditional art world forever I've made the most of the opportunities visiting a huge amount of galleries and exhibitions. The benefit of free entry (which an RA staff pass gives you) is that I don't feel obliged to stay in an exhibition I don't enjoy and also means I try out ones I would not otherwise of done.  For example popped into Van Gogh and Britain in Tate - didn't engage with it much so was done quickly - with the extra time decided to pop into Frank Bowling's exhibition which was magnificent and delightful and one of my top exhibitions for the year. That would be rounded out by the RA's Gormley exhibition and Lee Herring at Tate Liverpool.
</p>
<p>
  The arts community has been fantastic - art twitter is so welcoming and enjoyed joining in with Museum Selfie day and sharing Museum Bums pics.  It's also been fantastic being involved with the Tessitura project at the RA - this is a system that manges tickets, membership, CRM and more for arts organisations.  Through that community I've met so many people and enjoyed lots of other experiences - specifically got invited to see a number of plays. My favourite by a long way (and maybe the best play I've ever seen?!) was Fairview at the Young Vic.
</p>
<p>
  Two years in the arts has been brilliant - it's a symbiotic relationship - I've developed professionally (learnt lots about managing and tech) but also personally - both in being immersed in art and the confidence it's given me to learn more, read more and experience more things. On the flip side I've helped deliver a big project for the RA on time and within budget and really enjoyed helping my team progress and develop.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately my new job is still creatively based - I'll be working at Wonderbly which created personalised children's books.  There are lots of writers and artists working alongside the tech team and excited to see what new things I learn from them. For the next year I imagine I'll see fewer exhibitions but going to try and keep a goo balance of creative, arty pursuits up. It's a good balance combined with the sport and tech.
</p>
<h4>Other stuff - TV, Movies, podcasts and other recommendations</h4>
<p>
  With all the above there isn't much time for other things.  Believe I only watched three TV shows this year - Fleabag, State of the Nation and Have I Got News for you: Fortunately really enjoyed all of them). Film wise enjoyed Pedro Almodovar's Pain and Glory and also the Elton John biopic. Podcasts listened to The Dropout (excellent) and the Crypto Queen (average). The one show I do listen to religiously is Saturday Review - it's been my arts companion for the last two years and have enjoyed the discourse each week and also followed up on some of their recommendations.
</p>
<h4>Grateful</h4>
<p>
  Have been very lucky that there have been no major life events this year and my health has been good. There are always friends and family who need some support but nothing that requires significant sacrifices.  Through a combination of luck, privilege and hard work am in a fairly settled state. Am grateful for all of that and that stability has helped me enjoy a whole range of things as well as giving me the platform to offer help and advice to others.  I've got space to take on another mentee from February - feel free to message if you're interested. There have been rocky years in the past and am sure in the future so happy to enjoy a year which has gone by smoothly.
</p>
<h4>Review</h4>
<p>
  Seemed to hit the sweet spot of balance between exercise, tech and art. But that's only the top level superficial stats - grateful for friends and family who I get to hang out with and share and discuss the more nitty gritty parts of life. Will continue to monitor these parts of my day to day existence but always with an eye to the reality and broader complexity of life. Plus will try and keep up culture - maybe I need to record exhibitions seen and theatres visited? Maybe one more metric would make sense...
</p>
<h4>Appendix - Resolutions</h4>
<p>
  Generally I try not to set hard targets for resolutions - prefer to set broad goals and reassess as time goes by (usually during all those long runs! Prefer not to have too many firm targets as like to be flexible as the year goes and be open to new things.  My routine will change as my new job will mean a different commute - guess this will mean less reading, less running but more swimming and more yoga.  There's an upfront mental cost when starting a new job so plan to not do any side projects or much blogging for the first part of the year until some of the new challenges become more routine.
