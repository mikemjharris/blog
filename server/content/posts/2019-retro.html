<p>
  How was my 2019?  Life is way more complex and wonderful than a set of four metrics but in tracking a few things I get a pretty good idea how my year has gone.

<p>
  Pretty good year overall - roughly same number of books read, loads more running and yoga but less swimming and fewer blog posts. More isn't always a good thing - that amount of running seems a bit obsessive - was it a healthy amount of running or was it running away from problems? Here's how I interpreted the numbers (with the advantage of knowing how life wrapped itself amongst these stats tempered by the fuzzy goggles of self awareness)
</p>

<h4>Running more doesn't necessarily mean a good year of running</h4>
<p>
  Last year I ran the most I'd ever run.  This year I ran 50% more than last year! The main reason was signing up to my first ever ultra (106km round the Isle of Wight) with a couple of friends. Training consisted of lots of low intensity sessions which I fitted in by mainly running a few more legs of the commute. The benefit of this was that my social life wasn't particularly impacted.
</p>
<p>
   The ultra went really well and have loved the trail running community. Ran two more 50k ultras as well as using the London marathon as part of my training and racing in the Hackney half with techrunners. Over the summer I reduced my commitment with Techrunners - being the main person responsible for organising the weekly runs is quite tough over a long time and I needed a breather. Thanks to those who've helped out with making sure the runs still happen!
</p>
<p>
 Next year I have a shorted commute so expect to do less running. Main aim is to run a London qualifying time at the Milton Keynes Marathon and then fit in a few trail runs.

<h4>Swimming & Yoga</h4>
<p>
  No Swim Trek holiday this year which translated into the least amount for swimming for a few years.
 Did manage to complete the Looe island swim - was a special event for me as it's where my Grandma lives and where we played in the sea as kids. Next year planning on the same one and looking at some longer distance ones too so probably more swimming next year.
</p>
<p>
  After experimenting with yoga self practice a previous year I'm back in the swing of classes - mainly at Hot Pod Yoga in Hackney. Have made sure I had time to do the yoga to balance the extra running.
</p>

<p>
  This January I have a month off and am going to be completing my 200 hour yoga teacher training in Bali.  Super excited as has been a goal of mine to do for a while now and luckily managed to organise time off between jobs to finally get to do it.  Expect next years yoga numbers to be through the roof!
</p>

<h4>Book reading</h4>
<p>
  Roughly the same number of books read as the previous year. Continued to ensure I read a balanced set of authors. This year number of books written by females was XX, males YY and also (knowingly) read my first book by a non binary author. Highlights?  So many but probably Kintu, Mrs Palfrey and the Claremont, Pulp, Beloved and Winter. <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com">Here's the full list of books I read this year</a>.
</p>

<h4>Blogging and side projects</h4>
<p>
  Fewer blog posts this year and a few minor side projects including finishing off the books project, setting up automated lighthouse analysis and tidying up and adding all the infrastructure config around my personal projects to GitHub.
</p>
<h4>The Art World</h4>
<p>
  In last year's <a href="posts/2018-retro">retro</a> I outlined how working in the arts had a huge impact on me. This year has been even more pronounced as I've tried to make the most of the opportunities of working at the RA. I've visited a huge amount of exhibitions - the benefit of free entry (which an RA staff pass gives you) is that I don't feel obliged to stay in an exhibition I don't enjoy. For example looked around Van Gogh and Britain, didn't engage with it so decided to pop into Frank Bowling's exhibition instead. That was magnificent and one of my top exhibitions for the year. Others in that list would include the RA's Gormley exhibition and Lee Herring at Tate Liverpool.
</p>
<p>
  The arts community has been fantastic both at conferences, on twitter or at social events.  Met lots of people and as a result have had some fantastic opportunities such visiting the theatre.  Favourite play of the year (and maybe the best play I've ever seen?!) was Fairview and the Young Vic.
</p>
<p>
  Two years in the arts has been brilliant - it's a symbiotic relationship - I've developed professionally (learnt lots about managing and tech) but also personally - both in being immersed in art and the confidence it's given me to learn more, read more and experience new things. On the flip side I've helped deliver a big project for the RA on time and within budget and really enjoyed helping my team progress and develop. Fortunately my new job at Wonderbly (creators of personalised children's books) will still be creativly based and also I'm in the groove of theatre and gallery trips.
</p>
<h4>Other stuff - TV, Movies, podcasts and other recommendations</h4>
<p>
  With all the above there isn't much time for other things.  I recall watching three TV shows this year: Fleabag, State of the Nation and Have I Got News for you: Fortunately really enjoyed all of them. Film wise enjoyed Pedro Almodovar's Pain and Glory and also the Elton John biopic. Each week I listen religiously to Saturday Review - it's been my arts companion for the last two years and have enjoyed the discourse and also followed up on some of their recommendations.
</p>
<h4>Grateful</h4>
<p>
  Have been very lucky that there have been no major life events this year, my health has been good as has that of those around me. Through a combination of hard luck, privilege and luck am in a fairly settled state. It hasn't always been that way and am sure wont be in the future so am grateful and enjoying the current situation. I do some mentoring and advice (mainly for people learning to code and career changing) For anyone looking for a mentor I'll have spare capacity from March onwards - feel free to drop me a message if you're interested in what that might look like.

</p>
<h4>Review</h4>
<p>
  Overall an excellent year - there was a good balance between tech, exercise and art. In addition grateful for friends and family who I get to hang out with and share and discuss the more nitty gritty parts of life (as well as have a good time!) which aren't reflected in the tracked stats. This balance has taken multiple years and lots of effort and will continue to be a work in progress as I, life and the world around change.
</p>
<h4>Appendix - Resolutions</h4>
<p>
  Generally I try not to set hard number targets for resolutions - prefer to set broad goals and reassess as time goes by (usually during all those long runs!) - resolutions more take the aim of events or where I want to develop: For example the next year will resolve around entering certain running/swimming  events, completing my yoga teacher training and reading a few key books. The big change and focus for the next year is changing jobs. There's an upfront mental cost when starting a new job so plan to not do any side projects or much blogging for the first part of the year until some of the new challenges become more routine. Very excited about the new role and will monitor and see how it impacts the rest of life.
