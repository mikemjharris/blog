<!-- meta-data intro: A look back at the year that was 2019 -->

<p>
  How was my 2019?  Life is way more complex and wonderful than a set of four metrics but in tracking a few things I get a pretty good idea how my year has gone. If you monitor more than these four things then you are a data obsessive with no understanding of the beauty of life. If you aren't at least tracking these metrics then what are you doing - you're leaving your whole world to misunderstood randomness.  Obviously It is clear these are the four things to look at to see how life is.

<p>
  Pretty good year overall - roughly same number of books read, loads more KM run, less swimming and fewer blog posts but a whole bunch more bending.  But a higher number for each of thses isn't always a good thing - that's a hell of a lot more running this year but is that healthy? Were personal crisese that I self medicated with obsessive excersie?  Here's look into the story behind the numbers...
</p>


<h4>Running more doesn't necessarily mean a good year of running</h4>
  <p>
    Last year I ran the most I'd ever run.  This year I ran 50% more than last year! The main reason was signing up to my first ever ultra with a couple of friends.  We ran round the Isle of Wight (106km) one Saturday in May.  Lots of ways to train for long races but I went for the option of running more but at lower intensity. Fitted this into my week mainly by doing a few more commute runs and slightly longer weekend runs. Also while taking some time off after big runs I made sure I got back into at least low level training quicker than previous years. Am getting older and find having an extended fallow period makes getting back into training pretty tough.
  </p>
  <p>
     Loved the ultra and have really loved the trail running community. Post IOW ran two more ultras (50k in Tring in summer and 50k in Surrey hills in Dec). In addition ran the London marathon as part of my training and did Hackney half with techrunners (and suprised myself with my fastest time on that course despite lack of speed training).  Techrunners I stepped back in the summer - being the main person responsible for organising the weekly runs is quite tough over a long time and I needed a breather.
  </p>
     <p>
       Next year I'm moving jobs and will have a super short commute.  Whilst I can definitely make the run home longer it's hard to push and do those extra KM on days when you are tired.  I expect next year to run less but am planning on doing more high quality runs - hoping to join some track and hill training sessions. Main aim of the year is to run a London marathon qualifying time in Milton Keynes marathon in may and then run a couple of ultra trail runs.
</p>

  <h4>Swimmign & Yoga</h4>
  <p>
    Least amount of swming this year - mainly because I didn't do a SwimTrek holiday.  Planning on doing one next year and my new office is near the Lido so expect much more swimming next year.  This year swam the 1 mile Looe island swim - it's where my Grandma lives and meant a lot to do a big swim in the sea where we played around as kids. Next year planning on the same one and looking at some longer distance ones too.
  </p>
  <p>
    After experimenting with self pracitce a previous year I'm back in the swing of classes - mainly at Hot Pod Yoga in hackney. Have made sure I had time to do the yoga to balance the extra running I do - generally when I run but don't do yoga I get injured - this year has been fine.
    </p>

    <p>
       January I have a month off and am going to be completing my 200 hour yoga teacher training in Bali.  Super excited as has been a goal of mine to do for a while now and luckily managed to organise time off between jobs to finally get to do it.  Expect next years yoga numbers to be through the roof!
    </p>

<h4>Book reading</h4>
<p>
  Roughly the same number of books read as the previous year. Continued to ensure I read a balanced set of authors - I track gender but also try and make sure that I read authors from all over the world and with different voices and backgrounds.  On the gender fron read XX by females, YY male and (knowingly) read my first book by a non binary author. Highlights?  So many but probably Kintu, Mrs Palfrey and the Claremont, Pulp, Beloved and Winter. Full list of books I read this year <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com">here</a>
</p>

<h4>Blogging and side projects</h4>
<p>
   Fewer blog posts this year but above a post every other month. Side projects: I finished off the books project (link in previous paragraph), created automated lighthouse testing for some of my sites and tidied up and added to it all the infrastructure config around my personal projects. Got a few draft blog posts for next year but no major ideas for side proejcts (although half way through an instagram preview app). Probably take a breather on that front for the first half of next year.
</p>
<h4>The art world</h4>
<p>
  Similarly to last year this year has been hugely impacted by working at the RA. Knowing I probably wouldn't be in the traditional art world forever I've made the most of the opportuities visiting a huge amount of galleries and exhibitions. The benefit of free entry (which an RA staff pass gives you) is that I don't feel obliged to stay in an exhibiton I don't enjoy and also means I try out ones I would not otherwise of done.  For example popped into Van Gogh and Britain in Tate britain - didn't engage with it much so was done quickly - with the extra time decided to pop into Frank Bowling's exhibiton which was maginificient and delightful and one of my top exhibitons for the year. That would be rounded out by the RA's Gormley exhbiiton and Lee Herring at Tate Liverpool.
</p>
<p>
  The arts community has been fantastic - art twitter is so welcomign and enjoyed joining in with Museum Selfie day and sharing Museum Bums pics.  It's also been fantastic being involved with the Tessitura project at the RA - this is a system that manges tickets, membership, crm and more for arts organisations.  Through that community I've met so many people and enjoyed lots of other experiences - specifically got invited to see a number of plays. My favourite by a long way (and maybe the best play I've ever seen?!) was Fairview at the Young Vic.
</p>
<p>
   Two years in the arts has been brilliant - it's a symbiotic relationship - I've developed professionally (learnt lots about managing and tech) but also personally - both in being imersed in art and the confidence it's given me to learn more, read more and experience more things. On the flipside I've helped deliver a a big project for the RA on time and within budget and really enjoyed helping my team progress and develop.
</p>
<p>
   Fortunately my new job is still creatively based - I'll be working at Wonderbly which created personalised childrens books.  There are lots of writers and artists working alongside the tech team and excited to see what new things I learn from them. For the next year I imagine I'll see fewer exhibitons but going to try and keep a goo balance of creative, arty pursuits up. It's a good balance combined with the sport and tech.
</p>
<h4>Other stuff - TV, Movies, podcasts and other recommendations</h4>
<p>
   With all the above there isn' much time for other things.  Believe I only watched three tv shows this year - Fleabah, State of the Nation and Have I Got News for you: Fortunately really enjoyed all of them). Film wise enjoyed Pedro Almodovar's Pain and Glory and alos the Elton John biopic. Podcasts listened to The Dropout (excellent) and the Crypto Queen (average). The one show I do listen to religiously is Saturday Review - it's been my arts companion for the last two years and have enjoyed the discourse each week and also followed up on some of their recommendations.  That usually goes on my headphones for the first run of the week followed by any of the friday night radio 1 djs or podcasts from Above and Beyond or Ally and Filas. My runs are mainly for thinking and house/trance music I find it the right accompaniments.
<h4>Grateful</h4>
<p>
  Have been very lucky that there have been no major life events this year and my health has been good. There are always friends and family who need some support but nothing that requires significant sacrifices.  Through a combination of luck, privelige and hard work am in a fairly settled state. Am grateful for all of that and that stability has helped me enjoy a whole range of things as well as giving me the platform to offer help and advice to others.  I've got space to take on another mentee from February - feel free to message if you're interested. There have been rocky years in the past and am sure in the future so happy to enojy a year which has gone by smoothly.
</p>
<h4>Review</h4>
<p>
  Seemed to hit the sweet spot of balance between exercise, tech and art. But that's only the top level superficial stats - grateful for friends and family who I get to hang out with and share and discuss the more nitty gritty parts of life. Will continue to monitor these parts of my day to day existence but always with an eye to the reality and broader complexity of life. Plus will try and keep up culture - maybe I need to record exhibitons seen and theatres visited? Maybe one more metric would make sense...

<h4>Appendix - Resolutions</h4>
<p>
  Generally I try not to set hard targets for resolutions - prefer to set broad goals and resasses as time goes by (usually during all those long runs! Prefer not to have too many firm targets as like to be flexible as the year goes and be open to new things.  My routine will change as my new job will mean a different commute - guess this will mean less reading, less running but more swimming and more yoga.  There's an upfront mental cost when starting a new job so plan to not do any side projects or much blogging for the first part of the year until some of the new challenges become more routine.
