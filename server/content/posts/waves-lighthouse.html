  In the distance the lighthouse flashes out it's message of warning in the grey dawn light. Waves lap steadily on the beach. On the sand a group of us huddle round the light of a torch as words from a book are read out - "The sun has not risen yet. The sea is indistuingishable from the sky.."  Ninety years after those words were first published we look up to see if we can make out the horizon.
</p>
<p>
  The beach is in St Ives and I'm here for my second trip to study and discuss a Virginia Woolf novel with the <a href="https://www.litsalon.co.uk/">London Literary Salon</a>. The first trip back in <a href="/posts/2018-retro">2018</a> was focussed on To the Lighthouse. Four years later I'm back - this time The Waves being the inspiration for our disucssions. A less acessible book about many things including dealing with the complexities of human experience.  Although for a few days life isn't complex - it's a wonderful few days to discuss ideas in more detail and enjoy all the the opportunities that West Cornwall has to offer.
</p>
<h4>The Salon</h4>
<p>
 The salon is a unique opportunity to delve into more detail around the books - it's much more in depth than a book club.  There's regular sessions in London tackling works over a number of weeks.  For the travel studies it's an intense few days trying to cover and discuss these works which pose so many questions. I attempted a regular weekly study of Ulysses at the start of the pandemic but found a few hours of Zoom after a day of Zoom was too much.  The travel studies appeal to me - a chance to have a complete break from distractions and routine and an intense few days to really immerse yourself in the book.
</p>
<h4>Discussions</h4>
<p>
 Both trips there's been a group of around twelve of us, both times overwhelimingly female and generally older than me. Most of the group are regular salon attendees - some have done multiple travel studies and some had done studies previously of the books we were focussing on.  Everyone brought a different perspective, their experiences and knowledge. The discussions were very open and safe with expert facilitiation we manage to enjoy both freedom and flexibility to follow any line of interest, but still circle back to ensure we covered the whole book in the few days we had.
</p>
<p>
  We shared thoughts at the start of the study of our impressions -  tt was a relief to hear that people were frustrated, annoyed and angry at the book (as well as plenty of postives too).  This wasn't going to be a week of adulation for the book and author but a real chance to ideas.  It was a relief as I'd definitely stuggled with The Waves - it's a tougher book plus it's been a busy few weeks at work so hadn't been able to dedicate the focus to getting to grips with it as it descerved.
</p>

dinner?  other things?
<h4>Beyond the books</h4>
<p>
  While the study was the main focus of our few days there was plenty of time for other things. I signed up to all the optional extras - from sunrise swims with a couple of the group every day through to a trip to the Barbarra Hepworth museum (and a talk on similarities and differences to Woolf) and a riotious trip to the Minack Theatre to see a parody of Pride and Prejudice.  With all these extras the days were full - and exhausting - near the end of some of the studies sessions I found it harder to focus. One of the topic of the Waves is that we can't do everything in life - you have to choose a path and I was happy to have enjoyed riding the waves of entertainment even if it tired me out - I still got plenty from even the last discussions.
</p>
<h4>2014 vs 2018</h4>
<p>
While at it's core the salon hadn't changed much time passes and things do change. In an homage to To The Lighthouse my two trips spanned a global disaster - the pandemic.  From that remote working is now part of my every day life.  2014 I crammed so much into only a few days - this time I had more flexibility in my timings - arriving in Cornwall to visit my Grandma first then heading down to St Ives.  I'd learnt from 2014 that the study was tiring and exhausitn - I wanted to throw myself into all the activities again but added a few days at the end of the trip. A couple of days to reset, to have a breather, some tiem to myself and to also all the ideas and discussoins of the study to wash around in my head.
</p>
<p>
 The Salon has grown and done many more studies.  This trip was even better run with two facilitators taking turns to help nudge the discussion along. This time we were mainly based in a beautiful artists stuido with big windows overlooking the beach and waves of Porthmear beach. The people were different but at it's core things were very similar - lots of ideas and disucssions, frustrating, clarity and rolling waves of understainding and energy.  A wonderul space to think, listen and share.
