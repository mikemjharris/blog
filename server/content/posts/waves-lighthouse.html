  In the distance the lighthouse flashes out it's message of warning in the grey dawn light. Waves lap steadily on the beach. On the sand a group of us huddle round the light of a torch as words from a book are read out - "The sun has not risen yet. The sea is indistuingishable from the sky.."  Ninety years after those words were first published we look up to see if we can make out the horizon.

  The beach is in St Ives and I'm here for my second trip to study and discuss a Virginia Woolf novel with the <a href="https://www.litsalon.co.uk/">London Literary Salon</a>. Woolf was based here in the summers of the early part of her life and the sea and local imagery wash through her writing. The location means we can bask in the themes of the books. Back in <a href="/posts/2018-retro">2018</a> we took a boat To the Lighthouse in the distance. In 2022 our meeting took place in a beautiful artists studio overlooking The Waves break on the beach. Inside our conversation rose and fell, crashed over ideas spraying thoughts and conversation among us.

<h4>The Salon</h4>
<p>
  In 2018 I met Toby Brothers - founder of the salon - on a swimming holiday. I loved the idea of a trip away to focus on a book so joined the 2018 trip. The Salon runs regular multi week studies of a range of important books.  Life was too busy to fit that in until the pandemic hit - I managed a few weeks of Ulysses before realising that zoom all day followed by a few hours of zoom in the evening wasn't ideal. As I wrote back in 2018 the week away in St Ives was amazing - with the world opening up I was super excited to be able to join again.
</p>
<p>
 Both trips there's been a group of around twelve of us, both times overwhelimingly female and generally older than me. Most of the group are regular salon attendees - some have done multiple travel studies and some had done studies previously of the books we were focussing on.  Everyone brought a different perspective, their experiences and knowledge. The discussions were very open. This trip Toby shared facilitation with Sarah and this gave us all the freedom and flexibilty to explore knowing that a few nudges in the form of questions and thoughts would help guide the flow of conversation along smoothly to the end of the book.
</p>
<p>
  I love being in a group, especially over a couple of days to see how peoples energy ebbs and flows, how the group dynamic shifts and changes, energy levels rise and falls.  It's a unqiue experience having the space to chew over ideas and disappear down interesting avenues without a set agenda or goal. Much of my life is taking leading roll in meetings - this  was a chance for me to be able to relax into the flow, listen to the swell of ideas rolling around the experience and perspectives of the group, send the odd ripple of thought out and see where that spread.
</p>


<h4>Beyond the books</h4>
<p>
  While the study was the main focus of our few days there was plenty of time for other things. I signed up to all the optional extras - from sunrise swims with a couple of the group every day through to a trip to the Barbarra Hepworth museum (and a talk on similarities and differences to Woolf) and a riotious trip to the Minack Theatre to see a parody of Pride and Prejudice. There were organised dinners in the evenings and pasties on the harbour with the groups. With all these extras the days were full - and exhausting - near the end of some of the studies sessions I found it harder to focus. One of the topic of the Waves is that we can't do everything in life - you have to choose a path and I was happy to have enjoyed riding the waves of entertainment of so many opportunities even if it tired me out.
</p>
<h4>2014 vs 2018</h4>
<p>
While at it's core the salon hadn't changed much time passes and things do change. In an homage to To The Lighthouse my two trips spanned a global disaster - the pandemic.  From that remote working is now part of my every day life.  2014 I crammed so much into only a few days - this time I had more flexibility in my timings - arriving in Cornwall to visit my Grandma first then heading down to St Ives.  I'd learnt from 2014 that the study was tiring and exhausitn - I wanted to throw myself into all the activities again but added a few days at the end of the trip. A couple of days to reset, to have a breather, some tiem to myself and to also all the ideas and discussoins of the study to wash around in my head.
</p>
<p>
 The Salon has grown and done many more studies.  This trip was even better run with two facilitators taking turns to help nudge the discussion along. This time we were mainly based in a beautiful artists stuido with big windows overlooking the beach and waves of Porthmear beach. The people were different but at it's core things were very similar - lots of ideas and disucssions, frustrating, clarity and rolling waves of understainding and energy.  A wonderul space to think, listen and share.
