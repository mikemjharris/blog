  In the distance the lighthouse flashes out it's message of warning in the grey dawn light. Waves lap steadily on the beach. On the sand a group of us huddle round the light of a torch as words from a book are read out - "The sun has not risen yet. The sea is indistinguishable from the sky.."  Ninety years after those words were first published we look up to see if we can make out the horizon.

  The beach is in St Ives and I'm here for my second trip to study and discuss a Virginia Woolf novel with the <a href="https://www.litsalon.co.uk/">London Literary Salon</a>. Woolf was based here in the summers of the early part of her life and the sea and local imagery wash through her writing. The location means we can bask in the themes of the books. Back in <a href="/posts/2018-retro">2018</a> we took a boat To the Lighthouse in the distance. In 2022 our meeting took place in a beautiful artists studio overlooking The Waves break on the beach. Inside our conversation rose and fell, crashed over ideas spraying thoughts and conversation among us.

<h4>The London Literary Salon</h4>
<p>
  In 2018 I met Toby Brothers - founder of the salon - on a swimming holiday. The Salon runs regular regular studies of a range of books - with weekly sessions spanning weeks and months. This felt too much commitment but I loved the idea of a trip away to focus on a book so joined a special travel study.
</p>

<p>
  A burst of beginning of pandemic energy saw me sign up to one of the first remote Salon's to study Ulysses but the tidal waves of zoom meetings meant that intention soon got stranded. The 2018 trip had been so good that this year I jumped on the opportunity to join another trip to look into a different book.
</p>
<p>
 Both trips there's been a group of around twelve of us, both times overwhelmingly female and generally older than me. Most of the group are regular salon attendees - some have done multiple travel studies and some had done studies previously of the books we were focussing on.  Everyone brought a different perspective, their experiences and knowledge. The discussions were very open. This trip Toby shared facilitation with Sarah and this gave us all the freedom and flexibility to explore knowing that a few nudges in the form of questions and thoughts would help guide the flow of conversation along smoothly to the end of the book.

  I love being in a group, especially over a couple of days to see how peoples energy ebbs and flows, how the group dynamic shifts and changes, energy levels rise and falls.  It's a unique experience having the space to chew over ideas and disappear down interesting avenues without a set agenda or goal. Much of my life is taking leading roll in meetings - this  was a chance for me to be able to relax into the flow, listen to the swell of ideas rolling around the experience and perspectives of the group, send the odd ripple of thought out and see where that spread.
</p>


<h4>Beyond the books</h4>
<p>
  While the study was the main focus of our few days there was plenty of time for other things. I signed up to all the optional extras - from sunrise swims with a couple of the group every day through to a trip to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjWIs1OoH_6/"Barbarra Hepworth</a> museum (and a talk on similarities and differences to Woolf) and a riotous trip to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjZ41bRIryO/">Minack Theatre</a> to see a parody of Pride and Prejudice (much needed after a morning swimming in emotional murky waters at the study). There were organised dinners in the evenings and pasties on the harbour with the groups. With all these extras the days were full - and exhausting - near the end of some of the studies sessions I found it harder to focus. One of the topic of the Waves is that we can't do everything in life - you have to choose a path and I was happy to have enjoyed riding the waves of entertainment of so many opportunities even if it tired me out.
</p>
<h4>Post salon</h4>
<p>
  I'd learnt from the first trip how tiring and involved the few days could be - this time with the benefit of working from home (I felt my two trips spanning a global disaster reflected the structure of to the lighthouse) allowed me to arrive in Cornwall for a few days before and enjoy some time with my Grandma.  After enjoying swimming in everyone's company, thoughts and ideas I also planned to stay down in St Ives.  Friday morning we had our final session - covering the last chapter of the book that I'd struggled with and only skimmed before the trip.  After I took myself off for some space and art at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjadSyFI6P9/">Tremenheere sculpture gardens</a> then wandered along to the Jubilee pool - escaping the waves and The Waves in an art deco pool where I could let mind and body relax floating in the sheltered geothermal pool.

<h4>Hike</h4>
<p>
  The final treat I'd saved up for myself was a long hike from St Ives to Zennor - I'd attempted it in 2014 but hadn't allowed myself enough time so was excited to have a full day to myself to walk along the cliffs - observing the sea crashing into the rocks as I went and allowing some of the ideas and discussion to swirl and roll through my mind.  In the end the hike took <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/7932249587">me even further</a>to Gurnard's head a delicious lunch in a pub.  My mind was prepared to go further too and I paddled through the final chapter of the book again. A steady walk back to St Ives as the "darkness rolled its waves along grassy rides and over the wrinkled skin of the turf"

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
  A full week. A wave of thoughts and ideas.  An amazing group, the chance to listen, to share to swirl in thoughts.  The opprotunity to read, re-read, hear others and (one of my favourite parts) to read out loud. A tough, ambiguous and challenging book - often more ideas and questions than answers.  Even amongst us we couldn't quite pin down what happened -  the ideas as fluid as water.
</p>
<p>
  A huge thank you to Toby and Sarah for organising and facilitating such an amazing few days.  Thank you to all the attendees - for the warm welcome, for sharing ideas and your experiences. And finally an apology for the relentless wave metaphors crashing through this piece. Not quite the subtle imagery of Woolf but it's helped me enjoy this writing process.
</p>
<p>A superb study with art, swims, hikes, people and time alone.  The Waves suggest that life is a series of agonies and ecstasies. This week I was fortunate to enjoy riding the ecstatic wave.
