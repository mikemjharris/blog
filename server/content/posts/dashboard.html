<p>
  With a number of personal projects up and running in different places I wanted a central place where I could see the current status of my different sites as well as some info around what was deployed and when.  For this project I got to try out some new tech - some serverless technology on the infrastructure side and Vue Js framework and CSS grid on the front end.
</p>


<h3>Version.json</h3>
<p>
The info I want for each project is whether it is up and working, the branch that is deployed, the last commit and the date of the last deploy.  For each of my projects there's a script that add this data to a version.json file in the public folder. <a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/infrastructure/blob/master/deployment/version-blog.sh" target="_blank">Here's the script</a> that builds that data for this blog and here's an example of what the <a href="https://blog.mikemjharris.com/version.json" target="_blank">version.json</a> looks like:
</p>
<div class="code">
  {
  "commit": "1afcfb6d6fb110597eb220c6d8f0ca6da087bf89",
  "branch": "master",
  "deploy_date": "2018-10-23_20-06-59"
  }
</div>
<h3>Lovely Lambda</h3>
<p>
With the data setup for each project I needed to work out how I'd collect that data. I wanted to learn a bit more about some of the serverless tools available so opted to try and implement something using the AWS stack.  Speicifally I wanted a lambda function to calll off to all my projects and get the data. Javascript is my goto language and is supported by lambda.  Initally I setup a local node proejct that returned the the relevant info by making a series of calls to the various projects. Now how to run that in the cloud? AWS docs are very wide ranging and once you find the relevant part very helpful.  For lambda I followed <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/get-started-create-function.html">these docs</a> which along with a hepful and informative UI I was able to import my code as a lambda function.
</p>
<h3>Serverless server</h3>
<p>
With the lambda function set up I wanted to be able to trigger it and access the data.  The plan was to have an endpoint where I could call to get the data and expose it on the front of my project.  This setup feels very much like what you use a server to do - but how to do the same using serverless?  One of the tools is the API Gateway.  It acts like a normal API does with an endpoint you can call, this in turn triggers your lambda function and returns the data. All the functionality of an always listening server but only triggered on demand. Again I used a combo of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/getting-started-lambda-non-proxy-integration.html">AWS docs</a> and the UI to get an API Gateway setup with the lambda function. Here's the <a href="https://sasptp6a7h.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/default/nodeServerStatus">resulting endpoint</a> returning all the status' of my various projects.
</p>

<h3>Vue and CSS grid</h3>
<p>
To display the data on the front end I decided to use <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">VueJs</a> - mainly because I haven'tused it before and this felt like a fairly straight forward project to get started.  There's minimal logic and mainly using the framework as a templating engine. The docs on the Vue website were very helpful in getting an app up and running - not much to write about - here's a link to the <a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/dashboard/blob/4e0ebecd779e78b084df73850355283fd4ad3748/src/index.js#L1-L21">js code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/dashboard/blob/4e0ebecd779e78b084df73850355283fd4ad3748/server/views/index.html#L21-L32" target="_blank">html template</a>. As well as using Vue I wanted to try out CSS grid - the data looks and feels like a grid so wanted to experiment with that - CSS Tricks is my usual go to for instructions on latest CSS properties - here's their instructions on how to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">use CSS grid</a>.
</p>

<p>
In keeping with the rest of the project I decided to host the front end on amazon - creating an website enabled s3 bucket. I did want the project url to look like one of my projects so setup a proxy for the s3 bucket in the nginx server I use for my main website - <a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/infrastructure/blob/732cb11d56d5c5ba56b5ad5e8b9130d538064494/nginx-setup/nginx.conf#L64-L81" target="_blank">here's the config</a> for that.
</p

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>
  There are various abstractions for deploying serverless code - however I wanted to try out using standard AWS cli. For the lambda funciton this requires zipping up the folder with the code in it and using the cli to upload to the cloud.  Similarly for the front end - I used webpack to package up the code and used the s3 cli to sync to the bucket.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
I got to try out some new tech, learnt a whole bunch of new things and got exactely what I wanted - a site with the status of my projects.  This post has been more a list of what I did without special insight - I found the docs for each of the projects pretty comprhensive and didn't feel I needed to add anything - I've linked to all the relevant sections but happy to help out if you are looking to do something similar and need any tips on how to piece together the pieces.</p>
<p>
  I found the combo of the API gateway and lambda to be an excellent replacement for a server.  Speed of response isn't necessary for this project - I'll probably be the only one checking it and don't mind waiting a few miliseconds for startup. I appreciate that keeping lambda's warm is a challenge but not one I needed to address in this project.
