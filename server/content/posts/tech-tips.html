<p>
 There's loads of tips and tricks out there. Here's some of the ones I find particularly useful when using my computer - most of them everyone will find valuable and there are a few that I imagine only developers will care about.
</p>
<h4>When to try something new</h4>
<p>
There's a balance - from one extreme of constantly looking for the new shiny thing to getting stuck in your ways and wallowing in inefficeint habits.</p>

<p> I value a good, efficient habit and like to push myself to improve a process that seems inefficient - then make that new way of working a habit and rely on that.  With tech and learning new things I like to have a good idea of the problem I'm solving - there's always a bit of room for play and trying new things but I put the most effort and focus when I know there's a big payoff.
</p>
<p>
Most of these tips have stuck in my mind because they have significantly improved the speed or ease with which I work.  Pretty much all of them give me a little burst of joy as I remember the pain I've avoided from learning the new tricks.
