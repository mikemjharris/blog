<p>
This is an unashamed, self congratulatory ode to how much I love my keyboard skills. My hands dance over the keys, words streaming from their tips, dev tools opening after a magic combo of fingers flicks, tabs switching, panes resizing, lines jumped, macros run.

It wasn’t always this way. There’s no big secret in getting better - it’s taken time, effort and conscious practice.  This is a reminder to myself that these things don’t happen overnight and there’s a long slog.  Here’s quick journey of me and my keyboard stopping off at all the places where I’ve worked along the way. 
</p>
<p>
<h4>  The seed of inspiration.</h4>
My first job was in finance and being able to navigate an excel spreadsheet quickly  was essential - so much so that part of the onboarding exams they took away our mouse forcing us to learn keyboard shortcuts.  Ten years in finance and the shortcuts became second nature. But there was a catch - I was still tapping away with a couple of fingers not touch typing. 
</p>
<h4>Consciously deciding to get better</h4>
<p>
In 2011 I’d decided my future lay in coding.  I started working out what I needed to do to become a coder.  I realised I’d have to learn a whole bunch more about coding. But I also thought that if I was to spend a large chunk of my life wielding a keyboard I should try and make sure I could use it as quickly and effectively as possible.  
</p>
<p>
I started off with online courses for both. Touch typing is a different type of learning - it’s a lot of repetition and practice and you can fit it into short chunks of the day. This was ideal and during coffee/lunch breaks I got to finesse my skills.  
</p>
<p>
I’d also been researching coding and learnt about VIM.  This seemed to tick all the boxes in how I wanted to operate - purely focused on using the keyboard with sophisticated key strokes to help make the terminal dance.  I was hooked.  I started learning Vim. It’s hard.
</p>
<p>
<h4>I’m a coder!</h4>
2014 I headed off to general assembly to become a  full time coder. My touch typing was ok.  I could navigate around in a single document in vim. I was going to rule the world.  At GA we used sublime text - this was awesome in terms of managing multiple files with a whole bunch of awesome features (multiple cursors swoon…) and I continued to code using sublime for the next year.  I still thought Vim might be somewhere in my future so I installed a vim plugin for sublime - in insert mode you get all the sublime goodness but hit the magic escape button and you can dance the dance of Vim, hoping from word to line to paragraph with ease.  
</p>
<p>
<h4>New Job, New IDE</h4>
2015 and I was off to MOO.  A big job at a big startup and a new big IDE to learn.  We were coding part of the time in Java and PHP and needed a more powerful tool - step in intellij. A bit more cumbersome than sublime but it worked welland to my delight it came with a Vim plugin too.  Hurrah. My touch typing had stalled a bit so I put stickers on my keyboard to hide the keys.  You think you don’t look at your keyboard but you do. Try a few stickers (i’ve got some spare) it makes a real difference although makes pairing hard...

<p>
At MOO I was introduced to sshing onto servers and run code there.  When on a remote server or when coding javascript/css locally I tried to use Vim.  However I was struggling with navigating around - i’d read a blog post once saying it was ‘cheating’ to install plugins so I was trying to do without.  Luckily there were a bunch of Vim users at MOO and a slack channel to share thoughts.  The assured me plugins were the way forward and after a bunch of tips and advice I installed Ctrl  and NerdTree among others and I was off - this suddenly made it a tool I could viably use.  
</p>
<h4>Practice and Vim Golf</h4>
<p>
I pushed myself to learn more, devouring blog posts, playing vim golf,  updating my vimrc file, asking others for tips and help and trying things out..  Leaving MOO and starting at the Royal Academy I left behind Java and PHP - onto Ruby and Javascript. Most of the team there were using Vim so I decided this would be my main day to day tool - I slotted in as if I’d been an experienced pro.  Six months on and I continue to grow and learn.  For most basic functionality I reckon I’m as quick if not quicker than other tools.  However it’s the power functions that are a treat - complex, concatenated regexs updating multiple buffers is now commonplace.  Writing quick macros means tedious tasks become simple, each one saving me previous time.  I can either be more productive or finish early. In a future post i'll be talking about how I've moved my dev environment to the cloud - I don't think I could of done that as effectively if I my keyboard skills weren't up to scratch. 
</p>
<p>
I want to code and I want my thoughts and understanding to be the limiting factor, not my interaction with the keyboard. Do you need to touch type or learn vim?  No not at all - many coders I know don't but for me it was worth it. 
</p>
<p>
It gives me a thrill when I learn a new shortcut or feature.  I know I’m going to get better but for now I want to sit back and bask in a seven year slog that has turned out just the way I wanted it to.

and I am sure I will continue to improve but it felt like a good time to remind myself of the steps and work that went into improving a tangeablle skill.

There is no secret - we all know that getting better at theings takes time, effor and concious practice.  However it’s easy to forget or to expect instant results.  This post is a reminder that these things take time.  Future me when learning other things can look back at this a remember that sometimes there’s a long slog involved.

Inspiration in the past
We like to think it’s the big things in life that shape us but sometimes its a one off event, a talk, a comment.  Think steve jobs attending a class about caliigraphy (https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/steve-jobs-the-godfather-of-fonts-as-we-know-them/).  For me it was the first proper job I got.  As part of the onboarding training was how to use your keybaord properly and specifically learning shortcuts.  One of the exams was to navigate a large complex excel spreadsheet without a mouse.  THe aim was that the method you interact with your computer shouldn’t be the limiting factor of how you work.  You can be more efficient - whether that means doing more work in the same time or getting to finish early both are attractive results.  Using a mouse if that’s what you are used to can be quick but moving your hands away from the keybaord can be a lag - and moving a cursor when you can directly interact with a function is generally always makes you slower.

For the first ten years I worked using windows machines and mainly in microsoft products - large complex excel spreadsheets, visual basic and ms access. I pushed myself to learn the shortcuts and loved being able to navigate around an excel spreasheet. There was one issue - i hadn’t learnt to touch type - i oculd  I knew I would be leaving to do a coding course at some point and wanted to pick up other skills that would stand me in good stead.  If I was going to spend the next large chunk of my life interacting with the keyboard I wanted to be as efficient as possible - so I started to learn touch typing.  Unlike coding there was less focus needed - lots of exercises start you off witha  few keys and while you need to pay attention you could fit a session in at the end of the day or in coffee breaks.  Doing a couple of 5 min sessions a day .

At the time I was trying xt editor with all the sublmie goodness but hit escape and you get some of the vim functionality.  At this stage I was still limited to mainly moving around in one file - but still found this could be super productive.

One great part of changing jobs is being exposed to new tools.  Moving to MOO I spent a large chunk of my time coding in Java which meant switching to a full blown IDE - the toll of choice at MOO was intelliji and the quest to learn new shortcuts began again.  Again pairing and asking people helped boost my productivity.  Again there was an excellent vim plugin.

The other half of my time was workininteraction with the computer is via the keyboard - going full in on this route has boosted my productivity even more - I know there’s more to learn and I push myself to pick up a few new tips and tricks each week. It’s super satisfying learning new ways to work with the computer and I feel that seven years of hard work has paid off.  It’s taken a long time but I’m now where I imagined myself to be and can see it all getting better from here.

There we go - as I said boastful and self congratulatory. It’s so satisfying when a long term plan backed by hard work and focus pays off so I deserve every bit of self satisfaction.
