This is an unashamed, self congratualtory ode to how much I love being my keyboard skills. My hands dance over the keys, words streaming from their tips, dev tools opening after a magic combo of fingers flicks, tabs switching, panes resizing, lines jumped, macros run.

It wasn’t always this way and I am sure I will continue to improve but it felt like a good time to remind myself of the steps and work that went into improving a tangeablle skill.
</p>
<p>
There is no secret - we all know that getting better at theings takes time, effor and concious practice.  However it’s easy to forget or to expect instant results.  This post is a reminder that these things take time.  Future me when learning other things can look back at this a remember that sometimes there’s a long slog involved.

<h4>Inspiration in the past</h4>
We like to think it’s the big things in life that shape us but sometimes its a one off event, a talk, a comment.  Think steve jobs attending a class about caliigraphy (https://www.digitaltrends.com/apple/steve-jobs-the-godfather-of-fonts-as-we-know-them/).  For me it was the first proper job I got.  As part of the onboarding training was how to use your keybaord properly and specifically learning shortcuts.  One of the exams was to navigate a large complex excel spreadsheet without a mouse.  THe aim was that the method you interact with your computer shouldn’t be the limiting factor of how you work.  You can be more efficient - whether that means doing more work in the same time or getting to finish early both are attractive results.  Using a mouse if that’s what you are used to can be quick but moving your hands away from the keybaord can be a lag - and moving a cursor when you can directly interact with a function is generally always makes you slower.
</p>
<p>
For the first ten years I worked using windows machines and mainly in microsoft products - large complex excel spreadsheets, visual basic and ms access. I pushed myself to learn the shortcuts and loved being able to navigate around an excel spreasheet. There was one issue - i hadn’t learnt to touch type - i oculd open a menu, paste values or formulas, switch tabs and panes but i was still pecking away at the keyboard with only a couple of fingers.  I was quick but there was a limit.

Pledging to get better at code
In 2011 I’d started looking into changing my career from the finance to become a developer. I started to learn modern web languages in my spare time. THis often required lots of time and focus and after long days at my existing job was hard to always fit in.  I knew I would be leaving to do a coding course at some point and wanted to pick up other skills that would stand me in good stead.  If I was going to spend the next large chunk of my life interacting with the keyboard I wanted to be as efficient as possible - so I started to learn touch typing.  Unlike coding there was less focus needed - lots of exercises start you off witha  few keys and while you need to pay attention you could fit a session in at the end of the day or in coffee breaks.  Doing a couple of 5 min sessions a day .
</p>
<p>
At the time I was trying to learn as much as possible about how to become a programmer and the tools needed.  Fairly early on I came across Vim.  This is a text editor that has been around for a long time - it is based in the terminal so pretty much entireyly text based without a GUI. It’s designed so that you purely interact with it ove the keyboard.  This seemed to fit in with the way that I wanted to wok - slightly perturbed by posts about the difficulty level I started back in  2011 to try and learn vim.
</p>
<p>
2011 until 2014 when I left my job and joined general assembly I played around with code and also with developing my typing skills.  By the start of the course I could touch type - all be it not particularly fast.  I’d been suing vim a bit but only the basic features - jumping between lines, editing words and that was pretty much it. 
</p>
<p>
At GA we all used sumblime text - during the course and for the first year after I loved sublime - my touch typing improved as I was practicing every day.  Sublime gives you lots of greta features for moving between files and understanding thee file strucutre of a project - essential when you are new to a code base. With the same mindset I learnt shortcuts either from the web or from askign colleagues - pairing is great for learning code but also for other thi
Sublime has a vim pluging - in insert mode you can still use it as a normal text editor with all the sublmie goodness but hit escape and you get some of the vim functionality.  At this stage I was still limited to mainly moving around in one file - but still found this could be super productive.

</p>
<p>
One great part of changing jobs is being exposed to new tools.  Moving to MOO I spent a large chunk of my time coding in Java which meant switching to a full blown IDE - the toll of choice at MOO was intelliji and the quest to learn new shortcuts began again.  Again pairing and asking people helped boost my productivity.  Again there was an excellent vim plugin.

</p>
<p>
The other half of my time was working with javascript and I found intellij a bit over bearing for that. In addition spent lots of time on remote servers and updating code.  

</p>
<p>
I pushed myself to try and use vim where ever possible.  I’d read a post somewehre about not installling plugins which made managing a larger project tough.  However there was a vim slack group at work and plenty of people who suggested plugins weren’t cheating.  I got busy researching bits and pieces and once I’d got ctrl p and nerd tree installed along with a buch of other helpers I suddenly found that my productivity boosted considerabley.  In addition from doing owrk on remote servers I’d discovered tmux - a windoew/pane manager. Learning the key strokes for this and using that with vim became a killer combo.

</p>
<p>
ALl this while my touch typing had been improving - my speed was ok and typos getting less.  To help encourage me along the way I brought some stickers to go over the keyboard.  It’s weird - you think you are touch typing but you’d be suprised how often you glance down at your keys to check. 

</p>
<p>

Leaving MOO and joining the Royal Academy meant that I’d be leaving Java behind and working with ruby and javascript day to day.  I decided that my touch typin, tmux and vim skills were up to it.  I started really challenging myself to learn more - doing regex cross word, practicing vim golf and scouring websites for new tips. Since january my main interaction with the computer is via the keyboard - going full in on this route has boosted my productivity even more - I know there’s more to learn and I push myself to pick up a few new tips and tricks each week. It’s super satisfying learning new ways to work with the computer and I feel that seven years of hard work has paid off.  It’s taken a long time but I’m now where I imagined myself to be and can see it all getting better from here.
</p>
<p>
There we go - as I said boastful and self congratulatory. It’s so satisfying when a long term plan backed by hard work and focus pays off so I deserve every bit of self satisfaction.
