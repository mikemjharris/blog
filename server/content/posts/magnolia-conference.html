<p>
  At MOO we have spent the past year building out a new CMS.  In June this year I spoke about some our journey, some of the challenges we faced and how we integrated Magnolia into our systems.  Check out the YouTube video below - feel free to drop me messages about any of the content.

<h4>Preparing for a talk</h4>
<p>
I've given a number of talks over the years in a wide range of circumstances. This was the biggest tech talk I've given and the first where I've been representing a company. This talk was about MOO and what we as a team have achieved and developed.  The way I prepared the speach is similar to how I have prepared for many other speaches:

<ul>
  <li>Once I find out I am talking take some time for it to sit at the back of my mind and sink in</li>
  <li>Start preparing the talk verbally on my commutes in.  I ride my bike and spend the commute talking.</li>
  <li>After a couple of weeks talking to myself try and build out a very basic slide deck - this makes you realise that some of the things that work in you mind while cycling through Hackney don't make sense in a real presentation.</li>
  <li>Keep talking to myself on my commutes - every few days go back over the slides</li>
  <li>Closer to the event practice as much as possible with a computer and standing up (not on a bike) as if you were at a conference</li>
  <li>Practise...</li>
  <li>...even more</li>
  <li>On the day of the conference have as much under your control as possible.</li>
  <li>Take a deep breath, smile and enjoy it...!</li>
</ul>

<h4>What went well and where could I have improved</h4>
<p>
In anything I do I try to celebrate and enjoy the parts that went well and try and learn from areas I feel I could improve.  Most things in life are never or as bad as you think.
</p>
<p><strong>Things that went well</strong>I had practised lots, the speech went well, I was confident and knew my stuff. I enjoyed myself and was happy with my performance.</p>
<p><strong>Things I could of done better</strong>I generally talk fast and try and slow down as much as possible when presenting - I did a good job but could of gone slower.  There wasn't anything humourous of funny in the talk - this was a big corportate conference and I was representing MOO rather than myself and I errred on the side of professionalism.  I think that I could of introduced some more light hearted sections.

<p>Overall the talk was well received - I got some good feedback and had some great questions/discussions post talk. The overall conference was fantastic - I learnt a huge amount over two days.  The first day was mainly big talks - the second day was more of the same with the option of some small 'un-conference' break out talks which which worked very well. Will hopefully be back next year!</p>
