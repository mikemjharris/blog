<p>
  At MOO we have spent the past year building out a new CMS.  In June this year I spoke about some our journey, some of the challenges we faced and how we integrated Magnolia into our systems.  Check out the YouTube video below - feel free to drop me messages about any of the content.

<h4>Personal Review</h4>
<p>
  For my talk I was pleased with how it went and that I was well prepared.  For future talks the things I would improve would be to speak slower and to add in some humour. Overall I enjoyed the experience and had some good questions after the talk and some good follow up email conversations.

<h4>The Conference</h4>
<p>
  The overall conference was interesting with a great balance of speakers and mini breakout sessions. Attendees included the full spectrum of developers along with sales and business people. A really interesting couple of days and I would highly recommend it if you use Magnolia or are thinking of using it.
