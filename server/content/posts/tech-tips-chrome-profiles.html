<p>
  Tech tip but this one's for everyone! I rely heavily on the Google chrome profile feature. It helps keep my personal and professional activities separate and is incredibly useful for tech testing. It's a great way to prevent having to log in out and of different accounts multiple times.

<h4>Keeping work and pleasure separate but available</h4>
<p>
  We're on computers all the time: sometimes during the work day I need to do some personal browsing, sometimes in the evenings I need to do a few work tasks. Prior to using profiles I had work bookmarks on my home computer, personal browsing on my work laptop. I've left jobs and lost history or saved passwords. But with profiles no more.
</p>
<p>
  Google profiles are sandboxed environments with separate browsing history, bookmarks, passwords and extensions.

<h4>Fantastic for freelancers</h4>
<p>
A great example of how this can be useful is for a freelancer with multiple clients. Each of those clients probably has, say, a Google Analytics account, a Figma account, a Notion account etc. By using a separate profile for each client you can be logged into a different Figma account in each profile - one can just switch windows instead of logging in and out in the same context. </p>


<p>Passwords are kept separate and if you want to have a sense of what work you've done for each client and well you'll have separate browsing histories in each profile.</p>
</p>
<h4>For everyone - Keeping work and personal separate</h4>
<p>
  You don't need to be a freelancer though - I have a work Google account and a personal one and keep separate profiles for each. If I move jobs I keep all my personal settings and passwords. You don't even need a Google work account - you can still set up a profile just for browsing even if your team uses another provider such as Microsoft.
</p>
<h4>Guest profiles - making tech testing easy</h4>
<p>
  Your google account has a profile and it goes with you wherever you go.  In addition you can create a guest profile just on your device  - I use this in lots of situations but mainly as a way to test the features I build at work.  Often I need to be logged in as multiple users at once.  Or I'm using a tool like OneSignal and want to test how notification permissions work for a new user. Plenty of other use cases where for a short period you want a separate browsing experience but don't lose your history like you do in incognito mode.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
  Lots of reasons to keep your internet activities isolated. Profiles allow your work and personal use to be separated. They also superpower web application testing. I have multiple profiles and have learned to associate the different colors with the different accounts - meaning switching windows to the correct one is a breeze and something I do multiple times a day.
