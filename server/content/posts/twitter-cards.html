  When I've shared posts from this blog on twitter in the past the experience is pretty bare with just a url showing up. I've been meaning to improve the how this works and finally got round to what was a fairly small tweak.

<h4>Twitter cards</h4>
<p>
By providing some meta data on your page twitter can pull out some info and create a better looking post. Twitter creates a 'twitter card' with a title, summary and an image. All this info is on the page - I followed the instructions <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards.html" target="_blank">provided by twitter</a> and added the relevant meta data.

  Twitter often caches urls and their meta data so any previously shared urls might not pick up the updates.  There is a <a href="https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator" tartget="_blank">validator</a> you can use to check the setup.  Here's a screenshot of my last post in the validator.  Looks much smarter and more trustworthy to click on!
