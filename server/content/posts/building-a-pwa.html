  PWA. Progressive web app. By using web standard technology you can create an app with the look, feel and functionality of a native app but that runs on any platform.  There are many other benefits and features - in this post I'm going to outline how I converted this blog to a PWA. Please read <a href="https://joreteg.com/blog/betting-on-the-web">this excellent article by Henrik Joreteg</a> for a more detailed look at much of what PWAs offer.

<h4>Build what....?</h4>
<p>
  The list of things I want to build is long. The list of things that others want me to build is even longer. But wouldn't it be great if the project I built and wrote about I could guarantee the reader had experienced. They could see and understand the design decisions, they would feel the bugs and the pain and could validate if I had overcome those. Wouldn't it be great if I could blog about building a blog?

  Yes it does sound like a whole load of meta, east London, extra skinny flat white, self indulgent bs. But I've already built an mvp of the blog - look it’s glowing at you from your screen. You're reading it now.  It is a side project squeezed into the small gaps that life sometimes provided but it does give an idea of the thoughts and process that I put into building a project. There were some interesting decisions along the way, I discovered some new tools and had problems to overcome.  I’m still iterating and improving. I reckon there are enough navel gazing, meta posts in this project to pollinate the blog and hope it is flourishes into something beautiful.

  I'll talk a little about everything from front end to backend, data storage to design choices, api to version control and my home brewed continuous integration solution.  Let’s hope I can balance tweaking the code and actually writing words.
