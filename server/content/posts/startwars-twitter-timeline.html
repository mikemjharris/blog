<p>
  My favourite side project is one I built about six years ago as part of a hackathon at the end of the intensive coding bootcamp that I did at General Assembly. It takes your twitter timeline and displays it as the opening credits for Star Wars.

<h3>Videoing my coding</h3>
<p>
  I revisiting this project would be a good opportunity to try out recording my coding and sharing it.  Lots of reasons for this - I wanted to look at how I coded from a distance, wanted to see if I could talk and code while beeing 'watched' and also to share how I work.  I've learnt a huge amount from pairing and sharing ideas with people I've worked with and have done a lot of research and practice into how I interact my coding tools.  Hopefully people will find it interesting either to see new ways of working - either to pick up tips or just be happy with their own methods!
</p>

<h3>Aim of the project</h3>
<p>
  The project hadn't been touched for about five years.  I wanted to add in meta data to allow a nice twitter preview when you shared the project.  At the same time I decided to upgrade some of the old dependencies.
</p>

<h3>'One' take</h3>
<p>
  I didn't want to spend ages trying to get the perfect take.  I'd had a play around with the project so had a rough idea of what I wanted to do and also done a few trial runs with OBS https://obsproject.com/ screen recording software to work out the size of the terminal and layout.  In addiition I used https://github.com/wavexx/screenkey to show the keys I was using as I went. My daily runs are where I do my thinking so ran over a few of the thigs I wanted to share and thought through a rough plan of how it worked.
</p>
<p>
  About ten days after my initial play around I decided to go for it - was a friday after work and sat down and took everything in one take.  Worked out really well - as you'd expect there's a few mistakes, the odd mumbled word or unfinished thought but overall I felt it was fairly clear to follow along.  I took about an hour which I appreciate is quite long for a video - I think If I do this again I'd break out some of the tips I wanted to share into small pieces.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  For my first videod coding experience it went well - felt similar to pairing and my fingers defitely were a bit fatter than when coding normally.  Vocalising my thought process was good but quite tiring - was pretty wiped out at the end.
</p>
<p>
   The coding itself might be interesting but I think people will get more out of learning different ways to move about and interact with the computer. I love learning new tools and techniques and I find as my setup improves so does the my enjoyment of the process and the quicker I can get into the flow of coding.  I find that I enjoy the virtual enviroment so much that I don't need to worry about the environment around me so much - it means I can focus and be productive almost anywhere.
