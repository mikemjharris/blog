<p>
  This year I decided I'd set some New Year's resolutions. I've set myself three below - all are things I haven't done before and have clear metrics of success. 
</p>

<h4>2018 New Years Resolutions</h4>

<ul>
 <li>Perform an unsupported handstand</li>
 <li>Dry January</li>
 <li>Go to all of the Royal Academy's exhibitions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Perform a free standing handstand</h4>
<p>
As part of my regular yoga practice I've done handstands but always with support.  I've always wanted to do a free standing one and I hope this year I'll achieve it.  I have an idea of how to get there - mainly lengthening my hamstrings and doing lots of practice. On top of that I will probably need some help - I've got contact details to get private tuition as well as a studio that focuses on balancing. For inspiration I've been following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ZoeJonesHandbalancer/" target="_blank">Zoe Jones - Handbalancer on Facebook</a>
</p>
<h4>Dry January</h4>
<p>
  Being part of 'dry January' has never appealed, however as I've failed to go for any significant period without booze in the past year I'm hoping being part of a 'movement' will provide me with the social support and understanding to go for a month without. I definitely drink too much and would love to see how I feel after 30 days.
</p>

<h4>Go to all the Royal Academy's exhibitions</h4>
<p>
  One of the reasons for moving to the RA from MOO was to learn more about art. We work in the same building as the exhibitions and get free entry.  There is no excuse not to visits all of the events that are on in 2018! It's a whole new world for me and excited about learning more about it. 
</p>



<h4>Achieving Other life goals</h4>
<p>
  Resolutions are a bit of fun and happen once a year. But how do I go about the rest of life or does it all happen by luck? Definitely healthy dose of the latter but I do try I run the rest of my life my having a direction I want to travel and grow. Then I set myself  a few long term targets and then plenty of small goals along the way. You could almost call it agile if that! The goals are focused on my sporting/fitness and my professional life.  For example recent long term goals included getting promoted and swimming between continents.  Both had lots of mini targets and reassessments along the way (the swimming one has taken a few years and multiple races and lessons!). 
</p>
<p>
  The resolutions I've set myself are all quite clear, self contained and if they aren't achieved - whilst being annoying - wont impact my broader life goals. But let's hope I do manage them!  Good luck with whatever your aims are this year.
