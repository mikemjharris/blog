<p>
  During the last few years I've been changing huge parts about my life - specifically my career. Back in 2013 I set some broad multi year broad goals and since then have operated in a much more agile manner - reassessing my progress regularly, setting myself new targets and specific aims along the way as needed. There has always been the aim to balance everything in life but the main focus has been to accelerate my professional progress in a new direction. Overall I'm on track or have achieved what I set out to do and this year I can take a bit of a breath and ensure that I am not neglecting any part of what I want to be part of a balance life.
</p>

<p> 
  As such am setting a few old school New Years resolutions and documenting them here - sharing aims I belive can help in achieving them. These are mainly personal targets - my professional ones I will continue to work on with colleagues at work and my mentors and have shorter and more focused feedback on.

<h4>2018 New Years Resolutions</h4>

<ul>
 <li>Run sub 3h Marathon</li>
 <li>Perform a free standing handstand</li>
 <li>Dry January</li>
 <li>Weight <= 85 kg (currently 90)</li>
 <li>Go to all of the Royal Academy's exhibitions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sub 3h Marathon</h4>
<p>
  Running keeps me sane and fit.  The last couple of years I've focused more on improving my swimming with the result that my running is no where near as good as it used to be, struggling in the couple of marathons I have entered. This year the aim is to get back into a regular rhythm - I've run a number of sub 3h marathons and love the feel of being super fit.  I've got training records for the last ten years so know what needs to be done - just need to fit it in.  New job location by Green Park means that I'll have loads of new places to see and explore. Currently aiming to achieve this goal at the London Marathon in April.
</p>
<h4>Perform a free standing handstand</h4>
<p>
  It's been an aim for a while. I've done handstands as part of my regular yoga practice but always with support.  I need to lengthen my hamstrings and work on my techniuqe. It'll need focus and I've also researched classes as think some specialist help is necessary. Probably focus on this goal post marathon in the summer.
</p>
<h4>Dry January</h4>
<p>
  Being part of 'dry January' has never appealed, however as I've failed to go for any significant period without booze in the past year I'm hoping being part of a 'movement' will provide me with the social support and understanding to go for a month without. I definitely drink too much and would love to see how I feel after 30 days.
</p>
<h4>Weight <= 85kg</h4>
<p>
 I'm currently at ~90kg which is at the top end of my 10 year range. Usually I rely on fitness to keep trim and eat and drink what I like. When the training reduces though I put on weight. I'm going to spend the next few months doing more research on food and trying to balance the type and amount I eat based on my fitness regime.  Have found Am getting too old just run off the belly.  Should hit the target as part of marathon training (race weight is usually 82kg) but would like to stay around 85kg after April. 
 ver the past few years am usually happiest and feel and look my best when am 84 - 86kg (depening on the amount of weight training and muscle mass I have). Goal is to be at 85kg at the end of each quater.

<h4>Go to all the Royal Academy's exhibitions</h4>
<p>
  One of the reasons for moving to the RA from MOO was to learn more about art. We work in the same building as the exhibitions and get free entry.  There is no excuse not to vists all of the events that are on in 2018! It's a whole new world for me and excited about learning more about it.
