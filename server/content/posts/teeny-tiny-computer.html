The last few years I've been on a vague quest to find a super tiny but powerful computer. Finally I've found a 10inch laptop that is powerful enough to work as my main laptop plus doubles up as a fun, portable device.

<h4>Replacing a Dell XPS 13</h4>
<p>
My last few computers have been Dell XPS 13s. Along the way I tried using a <a href="/posts/coding-with-a-chromebook">Chromebook</a> hooked up to the cloud and a failed attempt at coding on a <a href="/posts/my-attempts-at-wsl">Surface Go</a>. I'd come to the conclusion that I'd always be stuck with a 13 inch laptop - but then I found in the depths of the internet the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000903896868.html">One-Netbook 5</a> - Intel I7, 32Gb RAM and 10 inch screen - but was it any good? Short answer - yes! It's my day to day laptop now. My job is writing code and it's more than up to the task - it even sped up build times on my work project by a factor of 3 from my previous decent specced Dell.

<p> 
Not only did I have the speed but I had amazing portability - see the pictures for how easily the laptop fits on a train and in comparison with a 13inch Mac. It looks and feels like a leatherbound journal.

<h4>Downsides</h4>
<p>
Compared to the Dell - none really.  But both the Dell and the teeny tiny computer both have poor (or indeed no!) camera and relatively poor battery life.  I got a super portable Opal tadpole camera and a battery pack (see pics). Both of these I would use anyway with another windows laptop and provide enhanced quality and power.

<h4>Upsides</h4>
<p>
The main upside is the size. For a large chunk of the day though it's hooked up to a wide screen, separate keyboard and camera.  But when I'm out and about it gets thrown in a small shoulder bag and I'm off.  It looks super fancy and while my enjoyment of it is the main thing I've also appreciated the multiple complimentary comments. 
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p> 
The downsides of the camera and battery are a minor inconvenience and am hoping a future version with the new Copilot PCs will fix those issues.  If you like small laptops like I do then it's brilliant.
