The last few years I've been on a vague quest to find a super tiny  but powerful computer. Along the way I tried using a <a href="/posts/coding-with-a-chromebook">Chromebook</a> hooked up to the cloud and a failed attempt at coding on a <a href="/posts/my-attempts-at-wsl">Surface Go</a>. I'd come to the conclusion that I'd always be stuck with a 13 inch laptop - but then I found in the depths of the internet the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000903896868.html">One-Netbook 5</a> - Intel I7, 32gb RAM and 10 inches - but was it any good? Short answer - yes! It's my day to day laptop now.

<h4>Replacing a Dell XPS 13</h4>
<p>
My last few computers have been Dell XPS 13s. Initially the new teeny tiny computer was meant to be a temporary replacement for my last one that didn't have enough power.  I just assumed a small computer wouldn't be up to my day to day job of coding. But it was! Nine months later and that teeny tiny computer is my main day to day workhorse.
</p>
<p> 
Not only did I have the speed but I had amazing portability - see the pictures for how easily the laptop fits on a train and in comparison with a 13inch Mac.

<h4>Downsides</h4>
<p>
Compared to the Dell - none really.  But both the Dell and the teeny tiny computer both have poor (or indeed no!) camera and relatively poor battery life.  I got a super portable Opal tadpole camera and a battery pack (see pics). Both of these I would use anyway with another windows laptop and provide a good solution.

<h4>Upsides</h4>
<p>
The main upside is the size. For a large chunk of the day though it's hooked up to a wide screen, seperate keyboard and camera.  But when I'm out and about it gets thrown in a small shoulder bag and I'm off. 

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p> 
The downsides of the camera and battery are a minor inconvenience and am hoping a future version with the new Copilot pcs will fix those issues.  If you like small laptops like I do then it's brilliant.
