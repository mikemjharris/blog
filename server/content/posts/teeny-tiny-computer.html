The last few years i've been on a side quest to find a super tiny  but powerful computer.  I've tried remote computing with a chromebook, pushed a surface go to it's limit and was resigned to sticking with a 13 incher for day to day work. But then I found in the depths of Ali express the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000903896868.html">One-Netbook 5</a> - Intel I7, 32gb RAM and 10 inches - but was it any good?

<h4>Replacing a Dell XPS 13</h4>
<p>
My last few computers have been Dell XPS 13s. The new teeny tiny computer was meant to be either a temporary replacement for my last one that didn't have enough power. I'd hope for greawt things but  assumed a small computer wouldn't be up to being my main laptop. But it was! Nine months later and that teeny tiny computer is my main day to day workhorse.
</p>
<p> 
Not only did I have the speed but I had amazing portability - see the pictures for how easily the laptop fits on a train and in comparison with a 13inch Mac.

<h4>Downsides</h4>
<p>
Compared to the Dell - not really any.  But both the Dell and the teeny tiny computer both have poor (or indeed no!) camera and relatively poor battery life.  I got a super portable Opal tadpole camera and a battery pack (see pics). Both of these I would use anyway with another windows laptop.

<h4>Size</h4>
<p>
The size is amazing - easy to use just about anywhere and powerful enough to do all my day to day work tasks.  The keyboard is at the limit of what's usable and I needed to relearn a few keystrokes but for me the benefit of such a small and light laptop outweighs that.  Most of the time though it's plugged in at home to a big screen with a seperate keyboard.  It's size isn't that relevant then but when I'm out and about it slots into a small shoulder bag and I'm off.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p> 
If you like small laptops like I do then it's brilliant.  The downsides of the camera and battery a minor inconvenience and am hoping a future version with the new Copilot pcs will fix those issues.  For now I love that it slots into a small shoulder bag and I'm off!
