  The last few years i've been on an unintenional quest to find a super tiny  but powerful computer.  I've tried remote computing with a chromebook, pushed a surface go to work and was resigned to sticking with a 13 incher. But then!  But then I found in the depths of Ali pay the Netobbok one 5. Intel i7, 32gb and 10 inches - but was it any good.

<h4>Replacing a Dell XPS 13</h4>
<p>
  My last few computers have been Dell XPS 13s. The new teeny tiny computer was meant to be either a temporary replacement for my last one that didn't have enough power.I'd assume the small computer wouldn't be up to being my main laptop. But it did! In my head I just thought super small computers even with that high spec woudldn't be fast.  But the build time for my dev server at work speeded up by 3x.</p>
<p> 
Not only did I have the speed but I had amazing portability - see the pictures for how easily the laptop fits on a train and in comparison with a 13inch Mac.

<h4>Downsides</h4>
<p>
Compared to the Dell - not really any.  But both the Dell and the teeny tiny computer both have poor (or indeed no!) camera and relatively poor battery life.  I got a super portable Opal tadpole camera and a battery pac (see pics). Both of these I would use anyway with another windows laptop

<h4>Size</h4>
<p>
The size is amazing - easy to use just about anywhere and powerful enough to do all my day to day work tasks.  The keyboard is at the limit of what's usable and I needed to relearn a few keystrokes but for me the benefit of such a small and light laptop outweighs that.  Most of the time though it's plugged in at home to a big screen with a seperate keyboard.  It's size isn't that relevant then but when I'm out and about it slots into a small shoulder bag and I'm off.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p> I really value small and light laptops.  I thought I'd have to compromise with power but I didn't.  The one bug bear (of this and other windows laptops) is the poor battery life.  A seperate battery pack sorts some of this out but I'm excited to see if the new copilot PCs that have much better power consumption will come out in this smaller form.
