It's great fun building visually interesting digiral sideprojects.  The browser gives you so much freedom to be creative.  However nothing quite beats a physical product. Recently I took advantage of being able to utilise one of the staff benefits of working at <a href="https://www.moo.com/" target="_blank">MOO</a>, free printing, to turn a digital creation into printed posters.

  Back in April 2015 I was playing around with how to use js to drag and drop in the browser.  Also I wanted to create something visually interesting. A number of projects (e.g. the hero image on Unicornhunt.io) were using shapes with different shades to creat fantastic looking images and backdrops. Using this as inspiration I build a random pattern generator that took a base colour and then displayed a number of square split into triangles with different shades of the base colour. The control panel allows you to set the colour and size of squares and then to highlight an area and download as an image. To get a better idea here's the<a href="https://www.mikemjharris.com/experiments/geometric-generator.html" target="_blank">geometric genratori</a> in action.

  For the printing I took a number of different square sizes and base colours and used MOO's printfinity to produce 50 posters of different designs.  We get free printing at MOO so was happy that it was low risk - fortunately everything came out as I wanted first time! Fun to turn digital into physical and was a cheap and easy way to decorate my shed with my own creations. It made me happy :).
