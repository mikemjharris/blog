<p>
The past few months I've been throwing myself into the museums world - it's very different from the tech world!  In January, through a long chain of events I ended up heading along to <a hre="http://museumsshowoff.org/" target="_blank">Museums Showoff</a> as a member of the audience. The event is billed as an open mic for everyone who works in and loves museums, it's hosted in the basement of a bar near Oxford circus and has a bawdy, loud cabaret feel to it. It was an awesome fun evening with a multitude of short, fun and interesting talks from across the museum's world all corralled by an awesome compere who did her own set of jokes and audience entertainment. As they have lots of speakers at each event Rachel who runs it is always looking for fresh blood - as soon as I followed the museums showoff twitter feed I got an invite to talk at the March event.

Tech lead <a href="https://twitter.com/royalacademy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@royalacademy</a> sounds a really interesting role… and not something that’s ever been talked about at our gigs! Would you like to do a set for us sometime?</p>&mdash; Museums Showoff (@MuseumsShowoff) <a href="https://twitter.com/MuseumsShowoff/status/950806364850458630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

<h4>Sign me up!</h4>
<p>
Of course I said yes!  I enjoy giving talks and have found it a great way to engage and meet people in the tech world and this was a great way to get into the museums world.  I had nine minutes to talk about what it was like being a tech lead at the Royal Academy of Arts..

<h4>The talk</h4>
<p>
Me at the event in March:

The challenge was different from any other talk I've given before.  The focus was on fun and entertainment and if people learn things along the way that's a bonus. From my short time in the museums world I've found that most organistations don't have a proper tech team and mainly rely on external agencies.  I wanted to highlight in my talk the benefit of having an internal tech team (mainly they know the organistaion, can move quickly and can iterate and improve tech over time.) and some of the complexity of the tech world. 
</p>
<h4>Showometer 2.0</h4>
<p>
When I'd attended the event previously I'd noticed that the countdown clock on stage was version 2.0.  I thought this would be a great relatable analogy as to how tech can get complex.  Why was something that on the surface seemed so simple - a clock that counts down - be on version 2.0?

<h4>The event</h4>
<p>
As with most of my talks I did it without notes.  As with all the other talks I make sure <a href="/posts/talks-oct-2017">I practice lots and lots</a>. The more I practice the more natural and off the cuff it seems.  The event was a blast - I had a bunch of RA friends along cheering me on.  The whole event was fun and entertaining and my section went really well.  The Showometer 2.0 analogy seemed to hit home with lots of laughs at the time and people referencing it to me after. Got to engage in person and on twitter with a diverse range of people from jobs that a few months ago I never really understood or knew existed.  Mission accomplished!  Would highly recommend it as an event if you are interested in the world of museums.
