<p>
  At the end of March five years ago I published the first post in this blog. Since then I've worked at four companies and been involved in multiple code bases.  This project has been a constant throughout - not just as a place to write words but as my own site to maintain and develop. This, my 46th post, is a reflection on what I've got out of the blog, how it's changed over the years and a look at some of the topics I've covered.
</p>

<h4>Five Years Blogging</h4>
<p>
  The first few posts were about <a href="/posts/why-blog">why I wanted to blog</a> and the <a href="/posts/building-a-blog">setup of the project</a>. Back then I stated that the reason for blogging was I thought it was a good thing to have, that I could use it to inform others and also learn things myself. One of my main concerns in March 2015 was that, like many new blogs, it would fizzle out after one or two posts.  But here we are five years later!  Have I enjoyed writing?  Have I got anything from the project and would I do anything different?
</p>

<h4>Having a blog has been a good thing</h4>
<p>
  Writing and maintaining a blog takes time and effort but it has been a fantastic project and I have got so much out of it. It's been a great way to document and diarise some of the technical areas I've covered over the years helping me track my progression. I've used it to share my thoughts on career changes which helps me understand what I want out of a job and has been useful to look back on when I've been considering my next move. This blog has also been a useful project when applying for a job as a portfolio piece. It's been a place to reference talks I've done and side projects I've built. It's been great to have a place where I can write and have also shared thoughts and ideas about some topics I'm interested in away from tech.
</p>
<h4>The Tech</h4>
  <p>
    The structure of the blog is my own creation - it's built with a number of <a href="/posts/blog-recipe">packages and tools</a> including node, express, handlebars and jQuery to provide an isomorphic server side rendered <a href="/posts/building-a-pwa">progressive web app</a>. The deployment process is my own <a href="/posts/deploying-this-blog">CI/CD pipeline</a>. It's been fun having my own project to maintain and update over the years. I'm the main user (and reader!) of the project and I get to enjoy building things for myself.  It doesn't matter too much if it breaks - it doesn't make any money, isn't essential to anyone so there is no pressure on me apart from the wish to keep it looking good and creating features that I want. </p>

<h4>Tone of voice</h4>
<p>
  There were lots of different visions of how the content of the  blog would turn out - ranging from a creative, grandiose, polymathic masterpiece through to a place for the odd note.  The first few posts I put much quite a lot of work into and the language was more creative and expressive.  When I turned to more technical pieces I found that that tone didn't fit so well and also took more energy to get right. Instead I focused on a more stripped down and clear voice - mainly trying hard to trim, cut and slim down whatever I wrote.  Mainly the topics have been tech related, even the thought section. More recently I have expanded on that by writing up end of <a href="/posts/2019-retro">year reviews</a> for the past few years and writing about <a href="/posts/summer-of-architecture">art and architecture</a> and at the same time trying a slightly more elaborate narrative. Learning and experimenting and enjoying myself!
</p>

<h4>Content</h4>
<p>The blog has been mainly tech related although have written a number of posts around my <a href="/posts/accidental-sexist">reading habits</a>, <a href="/talks">talks</a> I've given and more recently talked about other interests such as <a href="/posts/summer-of-architecture">art and design</a>.  How do I come up with topics?  Often I use some technology at work and am interested in playing around with it - I'll build a fun side project or expand the blog.  I find aiming to write a piece about it means I actually finish off the side project. Reflecting back on what I've built is both satisfying and a learning experience in itself.</p>

<p>Away from tech, things such as career changes or end of year retros are obvious content choices.  Apart from that I enjoy reading and have found using the blog to reflect on what I read has had a positive influence on the books I consume.  An initial post about books has spawned a number of others as well as a <a href="/posts/books-project-pt2">side project</a>.
 </p>

<h4>How I write</h4>
<p>
    One of my hobbies is running and I usually average at least five hours a week out on my own jogging. That's a big chunk of time and I generally listen to music and let my mind wander. Five hours a week of uninterrupted time (apart from crossing roads and trying not to fall into canals) gives you lots of space to think.  During runs I digest stuff that's been happened personally or professionally, plan for 1-1s, dream of the future, try not to think about how my legs hurt or are tired and also draft blogs posts in my head.

<p>
   Out on the streets i can let my mind wander, think about a broad outline of a post, rewrite, rethink, restructure, redo. Over a few weeks I can slowly let an idea wash around in my head, percolate, prod it a few times, push it, shape it and gently work out what I want to say.  Then I usually sit down and write out out a few paragraphs just to have something written down.  I'll usually leave it a few days, run around some more, come back to it and try and do one or two more sessions.  Trying to balance quality vs speed of delivery is always an interesting problem - I care that it's a decent piece but as the content isn't that important I prioritise delivery. Some pieces come easier, some harder.
</p>

<h4>The Future</h4>

<p>I've enjoyed writing, building and maintaining a blog. It's been fun and has helped me learn new things as well as providing me a place where I can write. It takes time and effort but with my current life situation writing a post roughly every month is fairly easy to fit in.  Given the current self isolation with coronavirus I anticipate writing more posts - when we can travel and see friends and the world again I wont mind having a break from the screen and writing!  Let's see where we are in five years - I'm guessing getting close to 100 posts but will only continue if I continue to enjoy and benefit from the project.
