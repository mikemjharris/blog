<p>
  Five years this week I published the first post in this blog! In that time I've worked at four companies and worked on multiple code bases.  This project has been a constant throughtout - not just as a place to write words but as my own project to maintain and develop. This, my 46th post, is a reflection on what I've got out of the blog, how it's changed over the years and a look at some of the topics I've covered.

<h4>Five Years Blogging</h4>
<p>
  The first few posts were about <a href="/posts/why-blog">why I wanted to blog</a> and the a <a href=@/posts/building-a-blog">setup of the project</a>. The reasons for blogging that I stated back then was I thought it was a good thing to have.  I also thought I could both inform others but also learn  things for myself. Back then I wrote about my concerns that lots of blogs fissle out - but here we are five years later!  But has it been a good thing? Did I learn anything? Is there anything else I have got from blogging and would I do anything differently?

<h4>Having a blog has been a good thing</h4>
<p>
  In a multitude of ways having a blog has been fantastic - it does take time and effort to maintain but I feel that I have got so much out of it.  Firstly it's been a great way to document and diarise some of the areas I've learn over the years.  Personal progress can be tracked by having a reminder of what problems you were solving at different times as well as having a reminder of sideprojects and a showcase for talks.

 The blog has also been a huge help during career changes. Looking back at why I chose to change jobs and why I chose the new one has helped me focus on what I want out of work. Before changing to the next position I look back at my motivations in different scenario. In applying for jobs it can be a big help showcasing yourself - being able to link to a number of posts that cover the job requirements can be a good starting point in interviews.

  <h4>The tech</h4>
  <p>
    The structure of the blog is my own creation - it's built with a number of packages and tools including node, express, handlebars and jquery to provide an isomorphic server side rendered progressive web app. The deployment process is my own CI/CD pipeline. It's been fun having my own project to maintain and update over the years. I'm the main user (and reader!) of the project and I get to enjoy building things for myself.  It doesn't matter too much if it breaks - it doesn't make any money, isn't essential to anyone so there is no pressure on me apart from the wish to keep it looking good and creating features that I want. Have managed to add a whole bunch of new features without it getting too complex.

  <h4>Tone of voice</h4>
  <p>
    There were lots of different visions of how the blog would turn out - ranging from a creative, grandoise, polymathic master piece throught to a place for the odd note.  The first few posts I put much more time into them and the language was more creative and expressive.  When I turned to more technical pieces I found that that tone didn't fit so well and also took more energy to get right. Instead I focused on a more stripped down and clear voice - mainly trying hard to trim, cut and slim down whatever I wrote.  Mainly the topics have been tech related, even the throught section. More recently I have expanded on that by writing up end of year reviews for the past few years and writing about art and architecture. I've enjoyed the writing and it's encouraged me to take a creative writing course - I think the blog will remain mainly informative tech related and will keep the creative stuff for my own consumption.
