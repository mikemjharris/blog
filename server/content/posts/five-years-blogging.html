  Five years of writing posts in this blog! In that time I've worked at four companies and worked on multiple code bases.  This project has been a constant throughtout - not just as a place to write words but as my own project to maintain and develop. Over those years I've written forty five blog posts. This post is a bit of a reflection for me on what I've written, how the project has developed and how it's changed over the years.

<h4>Five Years Blogging</h4>
<p>
  Five years ago this week I published this blog.  The first few posts were about <a href="/posts/why-blog">why I wanted to blog</a> and the a <a href=@/posts/building-a-blog">setup of the project</a>. The reasons for blogging that I stated back then was I thought it was a good thing to have as a developer.  I also thought I would learn from writing about topics and developing the project. Back then I was concious that lots of blogs fissle out but here we are five years later!  But has it been a good thing? Have I learnt? Is there anything else I have got from blogging and would I do anything differently?
