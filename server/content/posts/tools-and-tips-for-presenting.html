  Live demos.  Every coder at some point will do a live demo of their work, whether that's to the person next to them, in a team meeting or in a more formal context. Having done plenty of live coding demos as well as leading coding sessions for groups such as General Assembly and Mum's in tech I have recommendations for various tools and tricks that can make the process go much smoother.  It will always be nerve wracking but being well prepared and having the right setup will mean there is more chance that your demo will be a success.

<h4>Don't let your computer fall asleep</h4>
<p>
  Computers are great.  Leave them unattended for a while and they will go into sleep mode saving you battery. Often during a presentation or a talk you may pause to answer a question or engage in a discussion. Once you've finished you turn around and find your computer has locked itself. The chances are you will have to input your password - being in front of a crowd usually turns your fingers to overcooked spaghetti so you may have to fill it in twice. If you are hooked up to some kind of presentation system you may need to reconnect or reset your session.  I have seen this many times and it breaks up the flow of the talk and often flusters the presenter.

  <b>Solution:</b> Change the sleep settings on your computer before the talk! An even easier solution is installing an app which allows you to quickly toggle your sleep settings.  I use <a href="http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">caffeine for Mac</a>. This installs a small coffee cup icon in your top toolbar.  Click this and caffeine is activated and your computer wont go into sleep mode.A quick click after the presentation and you are back to normal functionality.

<h4>Set your editor with a light colour theme</h4>
<p>
  Lots of developers like to setup their text editors with a dark background and lighter text.  While great for local work it is incredibly hard to see on a big screen. Work out where you can change your colour scheme for your text editor and before a big presentation update this. The same goes for screen shots in slides. In sublime I find `iPlastic` is a good theme.
</p>

<h4>Tools for screen management</h4>
<p>
  First of all work out if you want to mirror your screens or to use the presenting screen as an extra monitor.  In most cases I assume you will have some notes to work off so will be using an external monitor. Using a mouse is great when you are working at your desk but trying to control a cursor on a far away monitor at a difficult angle is incredibly hard. Most developers know the `CMD + Tab` short cut to switch between apps but there are other shortcuts and tools for managing window size and position.  If I am live coding I will often want to switch between and editor, a terminal and a browser window.  Sometime I will want these to be full screen or split screen and I also want the ability to quickly move an application to my laptop.  Debugging code is sometimes easier when it is straight in front of you. 
<p>

<p>
  <b>Solution</b> I use <a href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/">size up</a>  It allows you to quickly maximise a window - move it and resize it to any half or quater of the screen and quickly shift it between monitors.  It's not only a great presentation tool but incredibly useful if you have one or more external monitors in your daily developer life.  It's relatively inexpensive and worth every penny.
</p>

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>
  Preparation always helps.  While you may have amazing computer foo at your desk, trying to control a mouse on a monitor over your right shoulder is a tough ask.  Practice before hand, learn any shortcuts and tricks and practice and practice and practice.
</p>

<p>
  Good luck!  Have  fun and enjoy the experience knowing that you have a solid setup and can focus on showing off your knoweldge and skills.
