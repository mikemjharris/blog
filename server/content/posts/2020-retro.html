<p>
  How was 2020? Looking at the numbers pretty much inline with my predictions from <a href="./2019-retro">last year</a>.  The only stat suggesting 2020 was in any way unusual was that I blasted through more books than predicted. This year we've all had to look and understand a wide variety of stats and what they mean - so what's the real story behind 2020s numbers?  How was my year of dealing with a pandemic?

<h4>The Pain of 2020</h4>
<p>
  At the end of 2019 I <a href="./working-at-wonderbly">left my job at the Royal Academy of Arts</a> went to Bali for a month and completed my yoga teacher training. February I started a new job at Wonderbly, had a couple of weeks of settling into a new routing and then the pandemic struck.
</p>
<p>
  Like everyone else since then I've been trying to survive the pandemic. How to cope when life changes?  The wonderful, messy complexity of life criss crossed with blunt new rules and restrictions.  How do you deal with a pandemic and the incredibly diverse ways we all live.  How to balance out the stresses, hardships, lost opportunities and health risks? Where's the balance between the community, your self, friends, family and the entire world. Is the state responsible or the individual?  Like with most questions there's usually a balance, the messy middle ground in the middle

</figure>
<p>
  By a mixture of luck and privelige, plus some planning and hard work I objectively had a less bad year than many. But still things were tough. The whole range of emotions from relief, exhaustion, happiness, stress and yes moments of joy too. Plans upended, life unbalanced.
</p>
<p>
  Lots of things led to a less stressful year than others: A home setup with a garden, shed and space; no kids to homeschool in lockdown 1, no kids to bring home infection in lockdown 2;  lovely, local shops with little to no queues; young enough (I turn 40 next year) to mainly have to be concerend with others health rather than my own, old enough to have some stabilty and experience. The biggest life saviour was a job and salary - the cherry on top was a company that cared for our well being and was incredibly supportive -  given the system we live in that security was more valuable than any amount of yoga, swimming and reading that I could cram into my schedule.
</p>
<h4>Pain from the past</h4>
<p>
  There was a stark contrast to the friends and colleagues  I left behind at the RA who had to deal with reduced pay packets and uncertaintity all year. While people were struggling everywhere, my personal connection to that world made the pain stab deeper.
</p>
<p>
  The events this year also triggered memories of 2007 when I lost my job and with it my American visa and having to move back to the UK. Seeing others go through similar circumstances again made my heart ache. The world is messy and for some they will grow and flourish but there will also be many who will struggle for years.
</p>
<p>
  Losing my job thirteen year had a big impact of my life: it sparked ideas of changing career - it's taken six years planning and now six years in a new industry to feel fully embedded and settled. In the nine months I was unemployed in 2007 I picked up yoga, reignited my love for running and staretd a spreadsheet sporting diary. That diary persists today and is where the stats in this article are kept.
</p>

<h4>Lockdown</h4>
<p>
  Yoga in Jan, new job in Feb and then lockdown. A brief panic thinking I would be unemployed and then settling down to remote work and trying tto find balance in an uncertain world. Balancing looking after yourself and others, balancing reading too much or too little news, balancing condeming critism for others versus understaning all the complexities of individuals situations. Throughout the year trying to work out what was safe given government guidlines, our own fears and needs overlayed with whatever news warren we'd disappeared down the night before.
</p>
<p>
  A quiter, calmer year with closer horizons but still so much life and joy out in the world. Many of my interests I could pursue in lockdown and others when rules and my own judgement allowed.
</p>
<p>
  My core hobbies were a great foundation to help me survive the year. Keeping a diary helps me manage routine through uncertaintity and help me reflect and respond to the ebbs and flows in my mood through the year. I try not to be a slave to the stats and to have space for other things in life - for example this year indoor cyclign on zwift - but havign that core stable foundation of hobbies provides a bedrock for work and other activities.
</p>
<h4>Yoga</h4>
<p>
  January I spent an amazing month in Bali completing my 200h teacher training - you can read more about that in my post - <a href="./all-yoga.html">all the yoga with all yoga</a>. February brought about new routines - I got to try out a new studio <a href="https://stretch-london.com/">stretch</a> as well as visit my long time regular studio - <a href="https://hotpodyoga.com/">hot pod yoga</a>.  Six weeks later though and all change as lockdown hit. I struggled with online live classes but soon discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene">yoga with adrienne</a> which was a daily morning practice through the dull monotomy of April.  Mid may though and my resolve cracked - couldn't face it any more and took a big break until August when studios opened.  As usual when I stopped I got a runnign injury so was so happy to get back into the flow by the end of the Summer. Got better at self practice alonside studio trips when they were open.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
  As predicted I did more yoga in 2020 but given about forty sessions were in January in Bali less than could be expected. The stats don't tell the whole story as I only count sessions over 45 mins which excluded the majority of lockdown sessions.
</p>
<p>
  The year reinforced two things: Firstly don't take breaks as it means getting an injury. Secondly I love being told what to do.  The teacher training was to give me the ability to lead my own session however in a normal week I put lots of energy into work, managing people and planning.I just want someone else to tell me what to do for an hour. Next year more of the same - hopefully a more regular practice and I anticipate a similar number of sessions.
</p>

<h4>Running</h4>
<p>
  Last year was a huge year for running and as expected I ran less.  One of the aims for the year was to inject a bit of speed and try and qualify for the London Marathon in 2021.  Back from Bali I swapped social runs with techrunners for track and hill sessions with advent runners.  In mid march just I took part in the Surrey half marathon and flew round.  The speed work combined with a strong core honed through hours of yoga resulted in one of the best races I've done - the first half felt so calm and easy despite rocketing along as part of the 1h 25min pace group. 8k from the end and the guy I'd been chatting to seemed like he had some fuel left too so we dropped the hammer and powered off for a storming last third of the race. Painful by the end but an almost perfect negative split run and best half marathon time for a while.
</p>
<p>
  Then lockdown hit and future races and events put into jeopardy.  April and May was a relentness consistentcy - knocking out a steady 50k each week through the Olympic park, along the canals or round Hackney marshes.  As the parks became fuller the center of town became more attractive - amazing to run through a deserted central London. There were trips out to see <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1253716942818607109">previous offices</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1326148321950494720">artworks</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1330119613087162372">Christmas lights</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the big events were cancelled (including my chance to qualify for London) but trail races were a go - they are perfectly designed for socially distancing and there were events from late summer through to the end of the year.  I singed up to loads of events expecting some to be cancelled - missed out on a couple in November but did manage to complete a couple of 20+km <a href="https://www.maverick-race.com/races/">Maverick runs</a>, the 43km Fox run and a 50km event down in Bournemouth that myself and a few firends had been signed up to do originally in March. Amazing work by the organisers to put theses on - thank you!
</p>

</figure>
<p>
  Running gives me lots of things but one I value the most is the stress relief and the time to think.  This year that has been especially important.  I've started signign up for events for next year but regardless of whether they go ahead running will always be there to provide a break, the chance to lug your body through the world, through nature and to burn away some of the worries and cares of the day. Prediciton?  Similar to this year I think.
</p>

<h4>Swimming</h4>
<p>
  Swimming was on and off again through the year - I wrote in much more detail about it in my post about <a href="./paddling-through-a-pandemic.html">paddling through a pandemic</a>.  It's a fantastic balance to the other sports I do and the floating serentiy it brings to life is priceless.  So many swimming highlights but fresh in my mind was a Christmas Day swim in the West Reservoir. Prediction for next year?  Just enjoy any opportunity to be in the water!
</p>

<h4>Book reading</h4>
<p>
  Epic year for book reading - with so much staring at a screen during work hours I was looking for respite during the rest of the day.  Books came to the rescue. <a href="https://pagesofhackney.co.uk/">Pages of Hackney</a> was my saviour providing not just books but friendly chats too!
</p>
<p>
  You can see a list of all the books and stats in <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com/">my books project</a>. I read twice as many female authors as male and one by a trans author - however since 2011 I still haven't closed the overall gender gap - expect to do so and write up about it in January.  This year inspired by the BLM protests I analysed my reading habits in regard to race in the post <a href="./accidental-racist" >accidental racist</a>. Overall this year 30% of the books I've read have been from ethnically contrasting voices.
</p>
<p>
  Favourite books?  With a longer list it's harder to narrow down: Finished the Ali Smith Seasonal Quartet which has been an amazing mix of current politics, art, coupled with the magical and some fantastic writing. Vanishing Half by Brit Bennet, Fleishmann is Ok and Burnt Sugar are all up there but so many others that have entertained provided the escapism I've craved.
</p>
<h4>Blogging and side projects</h4>
<p>
  Managed a few side projects at the start of the year - over a month off in Jan meant I had the mental bandwidth when I got back to have a play around with a few new things. It's been five years since I started this blog so wrote about that. At the start of lockdown tried out doing an online coding session and wrote up about that eperience.  Shortly after that though the online fatigue hit - no need to spend extra time shoevelling away at the code coal face.  All the posts for the rest of the year were non tech related - with topics covering topics including reading habits, swimming and changing job. Love writing and while it's still at a screen it's a very different process from coding and the usual work I do day to day.  As usual most of the posts get written in my head while out running so the actual writing part doesn't take too much time.
</p>
<h4>The Art World</h4>
<p>
  The last few years being at the RA I've been to a huge amount of exhibitions and was curious if that was just a new habit or something related to the job.  I was looking forward to going back to the RA and getting friends there sneak me into the latests exhibition - indeed in March I popeed by to see the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1235912967138484224">Picasso</a> exhibition.  Shortly after lockdown and with it galleries - sad not to be able to go but devestated for the impact the closure had on my friends and old colleagues across the whole sector.
</p>
<p>
  As with everything the rules loosened, gallery visits were allowed again and then it was up to individuals if they felt they were safe going along. Enjoyed going back to the RA for <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1296902912648589312">Gaugin, Spillaert</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1316313835263926273">Summer/Winter exhibition</a>. There was a fantastic day out to the Tate and Southbank to see <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1290009555049406465">Among The Trees and Warhol</a> and a trip to the garden musesum to see <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1317758032336531457">Derek Jaraman's hut</a>. Managed to also venture ouside of london with a couple of trips to <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1320634703104352257">Hauser and Wirth</a> as part of trips to Dorset and also caught an exhibiton about <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1301941408501297154">Art and Resistance in the American south</a> in Margate.  As with everything else there were cancelled trips - things booked hoping that it would be safe to visit but in the knowledge that some wouldn't be possible.  Have already littered next year's calendar with hopeful bookings for a whole range shows.

<p>
  Even when the world was locked down there was plenty going on - statues were getting pulled down across the world but here in London some were going up - from <a hef="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1297465424217542656">Thomas J Prices statue of a black woman</a> to a <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1326148321950494720">shiny cloud of controversy</a>. It was also amazing to see friends producing art from <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1294601794035879936">curating east London billboards</a>, crafting pottery and a whole range of other creative pursuits. Worth the stress of furlough?  Absolutely not - but shows that universal basic income could create a way for talented people to pursue beautiful dreams.
</p>
<p>
  Cultural highlights of the year? Among the trees was a close contender but had two standalone favourites.  First Far Away - a play by Caryl Chruchill.  It was on at the Donmar Theatre and is a short but incredibly powerful play - it's both subtle and in your face and while it's an old piece was incredibly of it's time - increasingly so as the year went by.  Huge power and emotions generated from a small cast and set. My other favourite was the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1337441411650777092">Emin/Munch</a> exhibition at the RA.  There was pain and anger but also a huge bubbling up of life and vitality. Again framed against this year it seemed to sum up the swirling complexity of life from despair to joy and everythig inbetween.
</p>


<h4>What else?</h4>
 <p>
   What else for the year? Being at home encouraged a switch from Radio 2 to Radio 6, less Spotify but started enjoying You Tube espeicailly <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1310899841426427907">epic socially distant sets</a> in amazing locations. TV wise surrferred watching from too much screen time - Last Dance and a couple of films in lockdown 1, We Will Destroy you in the summer and couple of films for work quizes in lockdown 2. Social Media really came into it's own this year - deiscovered instagram stories and loved catching up with what my yoga cohort was doing. Twitter is the messy everything of life and all the more valuable for it - highlights have been discovering new groups (hi copywriting twitter!) and sharing swimming pics. As a counterbalance enjoyed runs and walks in the coutryside and an increased joy out of <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1211263421183905792">gardening</a>. I rented a stationary bike from a friend at the start of lockdown - it really came into it's own in the Autumn with dark, wet evenings and loved riding with as part of team time trials on zwift</p>

 <p>
   Usually shop local but even more so this year, cancelled Amazong Prime, cashless makes sense but ensured I took money out each month to give to the local homeless. Donated more money this year than for a long time.  Volunteered in both lockdowns as a local volunteer but wasn't needed. Tried to balance enery for talking to friends, family.  Loved having time to myself and a break from the busy life of the last few years but concious I could only enjoy given the situation I'm in.  Seeing the range of experiences and imabalances out there and engaging with world events away from covid - BLM, cliamte change and a myriad of other imbalances in life that are still out there.
 </p>
<h4>Work</h4>
 <p>
   Throughout the year was so thankful for being in work and on top of that being somewhere that really cared how we were doing and worked hard to make WFH as good as it can be. Loved the more flexible days - we were trusted to do the work we could and could fit in our days around the standard meetings. Made the most of this to get runs out in the sun, finishing early to see art galleries and sometimes just taking a break for a nap. Managing a team took more energy and headspace than normal but was really happy with how we all worked - managed to change and reduce goals while still giving people achievable goals and having a succesful year.  A new job takes a while to get used to and espeicially when a pandmic kicks in but I feel welcome and valued at wonderbly and have enjoyed some good feedback. Here's hoping to a succesful 2021 and being able to support the team and colleagues as best we can.  I've loved the hybrid remote/in office of this year and hope it can continue.

 <p>
   The future of work?  We've mainly been remote but with the office open for restricted number of employees.  Being local and able to walk in have loved being able to break up my week by having a change of scene and also being able to see people in person.  Remote has worked well - a few weeks where we messed up some communications but we fixed things after that and there's the online fatigue. I'd love to see this hybrid world continue for me.  The future for everyone else?  I hope there's a wide range of different approaches so most people can join somewhere that fits what they want.
 </p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

  So 2020 hey? Incredibly thankful that I have a
