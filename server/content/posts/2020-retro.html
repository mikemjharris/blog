<!-- meta-data intro: A look back at the year that was 2020 -->

<p>
  How was 2020? Looking at the numbers pretty much inline with my predictions from <a href="./2019-retro">last year</a>.  The only stat suggesting that 2020 was in any way unusual was that I read a buckets more books than predicted. This year we've all had to look and understand a wide variety of stats and what they mean - so what's the real story behind 2020s numbers?  How was my year of dealing with a pandemic?

<h4>2020</h4>
<p>
  What a year - a huge world changing event effecting everyone.  We were all in it together and yet we weren't. We all struggled but there were huge exagerated differences across all sectors of society. The wonderful diverse, messy complexity of life imposed with rules and restrictions. Strong lines of what is allowed drawn bluntly through the wide ranging and diverse ways we live life. Was your hobby, passion, religion allowed or not?  Did your choice of how you lived, where you lived, who you lived with suddenly become a blessing or burden?  Trapped in 2020 by life choices made in the time before covid.  The constant balance of what is responsibility of the state, society, community, the individual.
</p>
<p>
  My 2020?  By a mixture of luck, privelige and some planning and hard work I objectively had a good setup to deal with the hardships - but even then things were tough with all range of emotions from relief, exhaustion, stress and guilt. Guilt for my good fortune and sadness and hoplessness for all those who were under water but still struggling in a world where hopes, dreams and life had been curtailed.
</p>
<p>
  There were lots of things in my favour this year - old enough (I turn 40 in March) to have stability, savings and a house to live in with a garden yet young enough not to feel (rightly or wrongly) existentially at risk from the virus. No kids to home school in the first lockdown or to bring home infection in lockdown two. Liveing in the ideal 15 minute  city setup - local shops within walking distance that were well stocked with little to no queueing, parks, outdoor space and then all the amenities of a big city. Yet I think the biggest life saviour was a secure job and salary - the cherry on top was a company that cared for our well being and was incredibly supportive -  given the system we live in that regular pay check and security was more valuable than any amount of yoga, swimming and reading that I could cram into my schedule.
</p>
<p>
  The pain and struggle that people were going through was clear to see and feel but there were two particular past events that triggered even deeper empathy.  First was my job situation - I left the Royal Academy of Arts last year - I loved my time there and they along with the rest of the cultural sector have been particularly hard hit by the virus - friends and colleagues on reduced pay, furlough and faced with uncertaintity. The contrast to my work situation was stark this year triggering so much heartache for those involved, layered with relief at my secrutity combined with guilt at my good fortune. I caught up with friends and offered support knowing that that can help but also feeling hopeless at circumstances outside all of our control.
</p>
<p>
  The second trigger event was thinking back to the start of the financial crisis in 2007 - I was working in America at the time but lost my job and with it my visa. Nine months unemployed and a forced move back to the UK.  Seeing others lose cherished jobs and have their security in this country threatened bought back tough memories from then.
</p>
<p>
  That break in 2007 was when I picked up yoga, reignited my love of running and started a spreadsheet sporting diary. That diary persists to this day and most of the stats in this article come from that. Out of that crisis not only did I try and find more balance in life but it also triggered my search for a career change - it took a six years of planning and preparation and now six years in a new industry to feel completely settled and secure. Unfortunately the pains and stress of this year will cause some irreperable damage and years of struggle but I am also sure that for others good things will come out of the hardship even if it takes time, effort and a bit of luck. For all those going through hard(er) times I see you and my heart goes out - I can't fix everything but I can help in some ways - if want a chat or need support.
