<p>
  How was my 2020? Looking at the numbers pretty much inline with my predictions from last year.  The only stat suggesting that 2020 was in any way unusual was the huge amount of books I read when I'd expected to have less time for books this year. 2020 has certainly been a year where we've been exposed to a huge amount of statistics and had to look at the story behind them to get the real picture. So what was my reality of the year of the pandemic?
