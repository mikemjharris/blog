<!-- meta-data intro: A look back at the year that was 2020 -->

<!-- meta-data category: thoughts -->
<p>
  How was 2020? Looking at the numbers pretty much inline with my predictions from <a href="./2019-retro">last year</a>.  The only stat suggesting that 2020 was in any way unusual was that I read a buckets more books than predicted. This year we've all had to look and understand a wide variety of stats and what they mean - so what's the real story behind 2020s numbers?  How was my year of dealing with a pandemic?

<h4>2020</h4>
<p>
  What a year - a huge world changing event effecting everyone.  We were all in it together and yet we weren't. We all struggled but there were huge exagerated differences across all sectors of society. The wonderful diverse, messy complexity of life imposed with rules and restrictions. Strong lines of what is allowed drawn bluntly through the wide ranging and diverse ways we live life. Was your hobby, passion, religion allowed or not?  Did your choice of how you lived, where you lived, who you lived with suddenly become a blessing or burden?  Trapped in 2020 by life choices made in the time before covid.  The constant balance of what is responsibility of the state, society, community, the individual.

</figure>
<p>
  My 2020?  By a mixture of luck, privelige and some planning and hard work I objectively had a good setup to deal with the hardships - but even then things were tough with all range of emotions from relief, exhaustion, stress and guilt. Guilt for my good fortune and sadness and hoplessness for all those who were under water but still struggling in a world where hopes, dreams and life had been curtailed.
</p>

<p>
  There were lots of things in my favour this year - old enough (I turn 40 in March) to have stability, savings and a house to live in with a garden yet young enough not to feel (rightly or wrongly) existentially at risk from the virus. No kids to home school in the first lockdown or to bring home infection in lockdown two. Liveing in the ideal 15 minute  city setup - local shops within walking distance that were well stocked with little to no queueing, parks, outdoor space and then all the amenities of a big city. Yet I think the biggest life saviour was a secure job and salary - the cherry on top was a company that cared for our well being and was incredibly supportive -  given the system we live in that regular pay check and security was more valuable than any amount of yoga, swimming and reading that I could cram into my schedule.
</p>
<p>
  The pain and struggle that people were going through was clear to see and feel but there were two particular past events that triggered even deeper empathy.  First was my job situation - I left the Royal Academy of Arts last year - I loved my time there and they along with the rest of the cultural sector have been particularly hard hit by the virus - friends and colleagues on reduced pay, furlough and faced with uncertaintity. The contrast to my work situation was stark this year triggering so much heartache for those involved, layered with relief at my secrutity combined with guilt at my good fortune. I caught up with friends and offered support knowing that that can help but also feeling hopeless at circumstances outside all of our control.
</p>
<p>
  The second trigger event was thinking back to the start of the financial crisis in 2007 - I was working in America at the time but lost my job and with it my visa. Nine months unemployed and a forced move back to the UK.  Seeing others lose cherished jobs and have their security in this country threatened bought back tough memories from then.
</p>
<p>
  That break in 2007 was when I picked up yoga, reignited my love of running and started a spreadsheet sporting diary. That diary persists to this day and most of the stats in this article come from that. Out of that crisis not only did I try and find more balance in life but it also triggered my search for a career change - it took a six years of planning and preparation and now six years in a new industry to feel completely settled and secure. Unfortunately the pains and stress of this year will cause some irreperable damage and years of struggle but I am also sure that for others good things will come out of the hardship even if it takes time, effort and a bit of luck. For all those going through hard(er) times I see you and my heart goes out - I can't fix everything but I can help in some ways - if want a chat or need support.
</p>
<h4>Year in Review</h4>
<p>
  In December last year I said good bye to the Royal Academy of Arts after two glorious year.  I took a month off to complete my yoga teacher training in Bali, started my new job at Wonderbly in February.  Just as I was settling into a new rhytm coronavirus and lockdown arrived. The end of March I celbrated my 39th birthday on Zoom surrounded by fear for my job and the world. Fortunately is soon became clear would be ok as a company - so April settled into morning yoga, work, zoom, lunch break, zoom, run, cook repeat. Tryign to find the balance between reading the news or being in blissful ignorance. May started with the same regular patterns to the days until it didn't.  The novelty had warmed off - morning yoga was a different memory but forunately so was the peak of the crisis - rules started to ease slowly.  Blinking into the brightness of society eased back into catching up with a friend in the park, pizza and tinnies.  June the pools opened - oh the joy of going somewhere for a reason, for an activity!  Feelings ebbed and flowed through the rest of the summer, low numbers giving a false sense of secrutiy and ease. Things were easier but not safe - there was the constant reading of the rules and then layering on whatever extra restrictions or easing depending on your own outlook, fear, history and whatever news hole you'd disappeared down the previous evening.  No trips abroad but got to see family in Dorset, Surry, Cornwall as well as weekend trips to Margate, Brighton.  Each time wondeirng if this was the right thing to do, trying to manage living life, looking after others, managing risks.  Autumn it felt clear things would get worse, the darker days meant the garden was less attractive.  Second lockdown and then the disaster into Christmas.
</p>


</p>
<h4>Yoga</h4>
<p>
  January I spent an amazing month in Bali completing my 200h teacher training - you can read more about that in my post - <a href="./all-yoga.html">all the yoga with all yoga</a>. Exhausted I arrived back in the UK determined to keep my pracitce up.  February I started a new job which brought about new routines - I got to try out a new studio <a href="https://stretch-london.com/">stretch</a> as well as visit my long time regular studio - <a href="https://hotpodyoga.com/">hot pod yoga</a>.  Six weeks later though and all change as lockdown hit - I wanted to support studios but struggled to find the energy at home for long online classes. I soon discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene">yoga with adrienne</a>. The classes are generally shorted (20-30mins) and found them biteszied enough to do every  morning until mid May.  I haven't countedt those sessions in the figures - they aren't the same as a full session. I managed a few longer practices too but by mid May I couldn't face online classes of any length - there was a big break until the end of August - by then the yoga studio had opened up and I was desperate to get back into the flow as I as I'd picked up a running injury (which usually happens when I take a break from Yoga). The rest of the year was a bit more consistent and managed a mix of online sessions with studio visits when regulations allowed them.
</p>
<p>
  My prediction was that I'd do more yoga this year but the total was way below what I expected.  One of the hopes of the teacher trainign was to give me a better practice on my own - it did give me that but doing your own session stll requires planing and thiking - after a busy day at work making decisions I really value having a teacher in person take on the lead role. The online classes are ok but I find the energy and focus of being in person so much better.  Some of that might just be because it's a pandemic year but I've come to similar conclusions before.
</p>
<p>
  Prediction for next year?  I want to be a bit more regular through the year and hitting at least two sessions a week should be achievable regardless of the pandemic. I didn't try and teach classes this year as firstly I was too busy and secondly I didn't want to steal business form exisiting teachers who might be struggling - would love to teach a bit at some point but maybe give it a bit longer.
</p>
<h4>Running</h4>
<p>
  Last year was a huge year for running and as expected I ran less.  The last few years I've focussed more on distance and trails.  One of the aims for the year was to inject a bit of speed and try and qualify for the London Marathon in 2021.  Back from bali I swapped by social runs with techrunners for track and hill sessions with advent runners.  In mid march just prior to lockdown I took part in the Surrey half marathon and flew round.  The speed work combined with a strong core honed through hours of yoga in Bali resulted in one of the best races I've done - The first half felt so calm and easy despite rocketing along as part of the 1h 25min pace group. 8k from he end and the guy I'd been chatting to seemed like he had some fuel left too so we dropped the hammer and powered off for a storming last third of the race. Painful by the end but an almost perfect negative split run.
</p>
<p>
  Then lockdown hit and future races and events put into jeopardy.  The next few weeks were some of the most consistent runs - knocking out a steady 50k each week, often through the olympic park, along the canals or running round Hackney marshes.  As the parks became fuller the center of town became more attractive - there were glorious long runs to see deserted city streets, running round an empty bank, around canary wharf.  I did trips out to see <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1253716942818607109">previous offices</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1326148321950494720">artworks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1330119613087162372">Christmas lights</a>, spotting <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1330777445339983879">Wonderbly adverts</a> on the side of roads.  There was a bit of a break in the summer where the lack of yoga meant I ended up injuring a calf but a few weeks later I was back out and about.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the big events were cancelled including the Milton Keynes marathon where I was hoping to run a London qualifying time. Trail races though are perfectly designed for socially distancign and there were events from late summer through to the end of the year.  It felt clear we'd have more restrictions so signed up to loads of events fully expecting not to make all of them but not knowing which ones.  In the end I completed a couple of 20+km <a href="https://www.maverick-race.com/races/">Maverick runs</a>, the 43km fox run and with a few close friends a delayed 50km event down in bournemouth that had been delayed since march - missing out on another Maverick race and a 50km event in November.
</p>
<p>
  Running gives me lots of things but one I value the most is the stress relief and the time to think.  This year that has been especially important.  I've started signign up for events for next year but regardless of whether they go ahead runnign will always be there to provide a break, the chance to lug your body through the world, through nature and to burn away some of the worries and cares of the day. Prediciton?  Similar to this year I think.
</p>

<h4>Swimming</h4>
<p>
  Swimming was one of the last normal things I did in March and one of the first activities to do with people when lockdown finished. I wrote about <a href="./paddling-through-a-pandemic.html">paddling through a pandemic</a>.  Love being back in the water apart from a small break for second lockdown. Fortunately even in tier 4 open water swimming is allowed and managed to bag a spot on Christmas day. It's a fantastic balance to the other sports I do and the floating serentiy it brings to life is priceless.  Prediction for next year?  Just enjoy it and see how it goes.
</p>

<h4>Book reading</h4>
<p>
  Epic year for book reading - with so much staging at a screen during work hours I was looking for respite during the rest of the day.  Books came to the rescue. I love my kindle but mainly because it's portable and splash proof - wtih travel cancelled then I reverted back to real books.  There's an amazing local bookstore, <a href="https://pagesofhackney.co.uk/">Pages of Hackney</a> round the corner from where I live and they provided books and good chats throughout the year.
</p>
<p>
  You can see a list of all the books and stats in <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com/">my books project</a>. I read twice as many female authors as male and one by a trans author - however since 2011 I still haven't closed the overall gender gap - expect to do so and write up about it in January.  This year inspired by the BLM protests I analysed my reading habits in regard to race in the post <a href="./accidental-racist" >accidental racist</a>. Overall this year 30% of the books I've read have been from ethnically contrasting voices.
</p>
<p>
  Favourite books?  With a longer list it's harder to narrow down: Finished the Ali Smith Seasonal Quartet which has been an amazing mix of current politics, art, coupled with the magical and some fantastic writing. Vanishing Half by Brit Bennet, Fleishmann is Ok and Burnt Sugar are all up there but so many others that have entertained provided the escapism I've craved.
</p>
<h4>Blogging and side projects</h4>
<p>
  Managed a few side projects at the start of the year - over a month off doing Yoga meant I had the mental bandwidth when I got back to have a play around with a few new things. It's been five years since I started this blog so wrote about that. At the start of lockdown tried out doing an online coding session and wrote up about that eperience.  Shortly after that though the online fatigue hit - no need to spend extra time shoevelling away at the code coal face.  All the posts for the rest of the year were non tech related - with topics covering topics including reading habits, swimming and changing job. Love writing and while it's still at a screen it's a very different process from coding and the usual work I do day to day.  As usual most of the posts get written in my head while out running so the actual writing part doesn't take too much time.
</p>
<h4>The Art World</h4>
<p>
  The last few years being at the RA I've been to a huge amount of exhibitions and was curious if that was just a new habit or something related to the job.  I was looking forward to going back to the RA and getting friends there sneak me into the latests exhibition - indeed in March I popeed by to see the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1235912967138484224">Picasso</a> exhibition.  Shortly after lockdown and with it galleries - sad not to be able to go but devestated for the impact the closure had on my friends and old colleagues across the whole sector.
</p>
<p>
  As with everything the rules loosened, gallery visits were allowed again and then it was up to individuals if they felt they were safe going along. Enjoyed going back to the RA for <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1296902912648589312">Gaugin, Spillaert</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1316313835263926273">Summer/Winter exhibition</a>. There was a fantastic day out to the Tate and Southbank to see <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1290009555049406465">Among The Trees and Warhol</a> and a trip to the garden musesum to see <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1317758032336531457">Derek Jaraman's hut</a>. Managed to also venture ouside of london with a couple of trips to <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1320634703104352257">Hauser and Wirth</a> as part of trips to Dorset and also caught an exhibiton about <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1301941408501297154">Art and Resistance in the American south</a> in Margate.  As with everything else there were cancelled trips - things booked hoping that it would be safe to visit but in the knowledge that some wouldn't be possible.  Have already littered next year's calendar with hopeful bookings for a whole range shows.
</p>
<p>
  Even when the world was locked down there was plenty going on - statues were getting pulled down across the world but here in London some were going up - from <a hef="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1297465424217542656">Thomas J Prices statue of a black woman</a> to a <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1326148321950494720">shiny cloud of controversy</a>. It was also amazing to see friends producing art from <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1294601794035879936">curating east London billboards</a>, crafting pottery and a whole range of other creative pursuits. Worth the stress of furlough?  Absolutely not - but shows that universal basic income could create a way for talented people to pursue beautiful dreams.
</p>
<p>
  Cultural highlights of the year? Among the trees was a close contender but had two standalone favourites.  First Far Away - a play by Caryl Chruchill.  It was on at the Donmar Theatre and is a short but incredibly powerful play - it's both subtle and in your face and while it's an old piece was incredibly of it's time - increasingly so as the year went by.  Huge power and emotions generated from a small cast and set. My other favourite was the <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1337441411650777092">Emin/Munch</a> exhibition at the RA.  There was pain and anger but also a huge bubbling up of life and vitality. Again framed against this year it seemed to sum up the swirling complexity of life from despair to joy and everythig inbetween.
</p>


<h4>Other</h4>
 <p>
   What else for the year? Being at home encouraged a switch from Radio 2 to Radio 6 - what took me so long?!?! Less spotify but started enjoying You Tube espeicailly <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeMJHarris/status/1310899841426427907">epic socially distant sets</a> in amazing locations. Not much to recommend on TV - in lockdown 1 watched the Last Dance (brilliant) and the OJ Simpson story on the bbc and a couple of films (best one being Woman at War). Then screen fatique set in and books took over - just about managed to finish We Will Destroy You in the summer, caught a couple of arts documentaries in the Autumn and a some films at the end of the year for a work quiz.  Podcasts? Listened to some of Louis Therouxs Grounded. No gigs or theatre but loved the band at the local market.  Lost a load of weight in lockdown and then gorged myself on pastries, park beers and life to rocket up 10% from June's lows. All the usual mix of lockdown and pandmic habits, zoom catchs and drinks, home cooking, an different ebb and flow to life.  Social media became a lifeline in quiet days - tried Instagram stories for the first time: enjoyed seeing my classmates from January's yoga practicing across the world, saw the trails from running friends and also a range of everyone's emotions and experiences through the whole year. Made some new twitter friends and groups - love drifiting into new twitter groups and got to experience some of the copywriting world this year as well as keeping up with swimming buddies. But then online again would be too much and back to a book or out for a run. At the start of lockdown 1 I rented a stationary bike from a friend and experience the online cycling world - in lockdown 2 I expanded my horizons and joined my friends online cycle team - the buzz of doing sport with others, hooked up via discord as we completed team time trials was an anathema to the solitary runs. The perfect sport for wet miserable winter days - pedaling away in my shed.

 </p>
<h4>Work</h4>
 <p>
   Throughout the year was so thankful for being in work and on top of that being somewhere that really cared how we were doing and worked hard to make WFH as good as it can be. Loved the more flexible days - we were trusted to do the work we could and could fit in our days around the standard meetings. Made the most of this to get runs out in the sun, finishing early to see art galleries and sometimes just taking a break for a nap. Managing a team took more energy and headspace than normal but was really happy with how we all worked - managed to change and reduce goals while still giving people achievable goals and having a succesful year.  A new job takes a while to get used to and espeicially when a pandmic kicks in but I feel welcome and valued at wonderbly and have enjoyed some good feedback. Here's hoping to a succesful 2021 and being able to support the team and colleagues as best we can.
 </p>
 <p>
   The future of work?  We've mainly been remote but with the office open for restricted number of employees.  Being local and able to walk in have loved being able to break up my week by having a change of scene and also being able to see people in person.  Remote has worked well - a few weeks where we messed up some communications but we fixed things after that and there's the online fatigue. I'd love to see this hybrid world continue for me.  The future for everyone else?  I hope there's a wide range of different approaches so most people can join somewhere that fits what they want.
 </p>


<h4>Good stuff</h4>
<p>
  Life is always trying to find a balance between everything and the events this year have made that even more important and at the same time harder.  I try and do my part for society, your team members and others around you while also trying to look after yourself. I was convinced I wouldn't be working after the start of lockdown so signed up to be a volunteer locally, donated to charity and set up a regular donation to the foodbank - all the while trying to manage personal finances - lots of costs were brought forward at the start of lockdown and there was increased uncertaintity about future earnings.
</p>
<p>
  As things settled down it was clear that the job wouldn't be an issue - fortunately I wasn't needed as a volunteer - I tried again in December to be a vaccine administor but again wasn't succesful. An aim for next year is to build up some volunteer experience. With more stability I tried to donate where I could to causes such as BLM (there's more to the year than covid!) and other institutions.
</p>
<p>
  The move to cashless was great except for the homeless - to help I would buy food and drink and also take out a chunk of money and give that to the few homeless nearby I know. You soon learn the cost of the night shelter (£8) or peoples favourite snack or tipple. It feels hopeless but sometimes you realise the system is working - JP who is usually outside the local supermarket finally got a house at the end of the year after five years living in a tent on the marshes.
</p>
<p>
  Why write about this?  Why donate?  Life is big and complex so many reasons. Yes I want to help out but some of it is also guilt that I am ok and also the want to look good and do and be seen to do the right thing. Always in two mings about writing about what should be selfless tasks but I've been inspired by others who share what they do - it helps you realise you can help out and that it's normal.
