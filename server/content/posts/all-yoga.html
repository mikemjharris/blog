<p>
  January 2020 I spent a month in Bali - most of that time was spent completing my 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training course with All Yoga.  I wanted to write a few words as a memento for myself as well as providing thoughts and information for anyone out there who might be thinking of completing something similar.
