  January 2020 I spent a month in Bali - most of that time was spent completing my 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training course with All Yoga.  I wanted to write a few words as a memento for myself as well as providing thoughts and information for anyone out there who might be thinking of completing something similar. Here's a pic of the wonderful people I got to spend a month with on a remote island - but what was my history with yoga, how did I choose this course and how did I find it?

<h3>My history with Yoga</h3>
<p>
   How did I end up at a month long yoga course?  I took up yoga in 2007 after losing my job in the financial crisis.  I'd had some serious injuries running my first marathon and wanted to do another without breaking myself.  Yoga helped me with that and I've stuck with it ever since.  My relationship with it has mainly been a physical practice - over the years it's been both a joy and a chore.  Sometimes it's felt hard to fit in, others I can't wait for my next class.  It started out as an aid to running but has become an interest in itself.
</p>
<p>
  A few years ago I thought after many years of paying for classes I'd be able to do self practice.  As I wrote in that year's <a href="/posts/2018-retro">summary</a> I stuggled to do enough sessions.  Part of wanting to do a teacher training was to have a solid understanding of the structures of a class to be able to put together my own session, also to learn a bit more about the other parts of yoga.  I'd done a bit of breath work before but didn't know much about the history of yoga and had completely avoided the more spirtual aspect.

<h3>Choosing a yoga teacher training </h3>
<p>
   I'd planned on doinga teacher training for a while - I almost did one between jobs in 2016 but didn't have enough time - I did end up in Chiang Mai in Thailand and did a few sessions there and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  One I missed was being by the sea - if I was taking month our of work I wanted to be by the ocean if possible.  If I didn't get on with the yoga I could always enjoy the water.
</p>
<p>
  My yoga teacher's in London have been great in recommending places to do the training and on their recommendation I was planning on going to Radiantly Alive in Ubud, Bali.  having been to bali ten years before I knew I liked it and Ubud seems the centre of yoga there however was cautious as felt it was quite busy and no ocean.
</p>
<p>
  In the end I was quite restricited in terms of dates - I had negotiated the whole of January off inbetween jobs which didn't fit in with Radiantly Alive.  After extensive google I foudn out about all yoga, I also read <a href="https://www.global-gallivanting.com/my-experience-at-all-yoga-teacher-training-in-bali/">this blog post by a previous attendee</a> (Anna is an excellent writer and that post is pretty much idential to my experience!).  It sounded great, I got the sea, the location seemed nice and remote and the dates fitted perfectly.  It seemd serious but not over the top.  I started following all yoga on instagram and from there a nubmer of the teachers adn students.  Turns out most of my future classmates were doing the same.  You're never sure what you are getting when you sign up to these things but spying on a class over the course of a month on social media meant you got a fantastic idea of what's to come.  Excited I booked in my slot, sorted flights, asked for a yoga mat for christmas (recommend corgk yogi mats).  December was super busy finishing of my previous job and a break was just what I needed.

<h3>Ten Days in Ubud</h3>

<p>
  In late Decemeber I arrived in Bali and headed to Ubud to meet up with a couple of firend (Maria and Elena) who happened to be there too.  I had bout ten days before the training started and this allowed me to see in the New Year, get over jet lag and explore the yoga options in Ubud.
</p>
<p>
  Ubud has grown so much in ten years and the amount of traffic and size of it now was definitely a detraction. Howeer once in the sanctury of yoga barn or radiatnely alive you felt well away from everything.  Both are big esttablishments with classes of 70+. Most of the yoga in London that I've attended but elena persuaded me join a kundalini class - it was amazing and was a great way to open myself up to other aspects of yoga practice.
</p>
<p>
  having that time in ubud was great - got to do a bunch of yoga, experiencnce the jungle and tick off a few of the must sees.  After a week I was excited to be getting a boat to Nuse Lembongan, a remote island off the east coast of bali where the teadcher training was going to take place.
