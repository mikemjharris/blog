  In January 2020 I spent a month there attending a 200h yoga teacher training course with <a href="https://www.allyogatraining.com/">All Yoga</a>. It was a fantastic, magical time. This blog post is partly a memento for me as to what I got up to but I also hope it will be useful for any aspiring yoga students who are looking into further training.
  <p>
<p>
  Here's a pic of the wonderful people I got to spend a month with on a remote island - but what was my history with yoga, how did I choose this course and how did I find it?

<h3>My history with Yoga</h3>
<p>
  After a few years of running injuries and finding myself with time on my hands in 2007 after being made redundant I decided to try out yoga. Since then it's been part of my life - sometimes a joy to do, sometimes a chore.  There have been many benefits with the key one being that when I practice regularly I don't get running injuries. Most of my sessions have been part of led classes and for the most part I've been focussed on the physical practice of yoga.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the many reasons for wanting to do a teacher training course including wanting a to be stronger and more flexible, being able to put together and practice my own session and also to get more of an understanding of the history and more spiritual parts of yoga.

<h3>Choosing a yoga teacher training </h3>
<p>
  Doing a teacher training has been on my mind for a while - I almost did one between jobs in 2016 but didn't have enough time. I did end up in Chiang Mai in Thailand and attended a few sessions. The atmosphere was amazing but I missed was being by the sea.
</p>
<p>
  My yoga teacher's in London were great in suggesting a number of places with one of my favourite teachers suggesting Radiantly Alive in Ubud, Bali.
</p>
<p>
  In the end I was quite restricted in terms of dates - I had negotiated the whole of January off between jobs . After extensive googling I found out about All Yoga. <a href="https://www.global-gallivanting.com/my-experience-at-all-yoga-teacher-training-in-bali/">This blog post by a previous attendee</a> was incredibly helpful - Anna is an excellent writer and that post is pretty much identical to my experience!. It sounded great, I got the sea, an amazing location the dates fitted perfectly.
</p>
<h3>Instagram Spying</h3>
<p>
  I started following All Yoga on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/allyogatraining/">Instagram</a> and from there a number of the teachers and students.  Turns out most of my future classmates were doing the same.  You're never 100% sure what you are getting when you sign up to something you've only seen online on a website but being able to remotely be part of another classes journey helped understand that this was the real thing.  It also helped to me to realise that this would be rewarding but hard work!
</p>

<h3>Ten Days in Ubud</h3>
  <p>
    At the end of 2019 I finished my previous job, enjoyed Christmas at home then headed to Ubud to meet up with a couple of friends. There were ten days before the training started and this allowed me to see in the New Year, get over jet lag and explore the yoga options in Ubud.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ten years previously I'd visited Ubud and since then it has got much bigger and more crowded.  I attended a couple of sessions at Radiantly Alive which were brilliant but I was glad I wasn't staying in town for the month. The best class was a morning Kundalini class at Yoga Barn - my friend Elena persuaded me to join. It's a much more spiritual class than what I was used to including my first chanting experience.  This was the most spirtual class I'd ever been to and I loved it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The time in Ubud was great preparation for the 200h training - I got to shake of the jet lag, get used to the climate and diet and start warming up with a few yoga classes. Happy and bronzed I was ready for the next step - a boat out to the remote island of Nusa Lembongan off the East of Bali.
  </p>

  <h3>YTT on Nusa Lembongan</h3>
  <p>
    Arriving on the beach was quite surreal:  there was the yoga shala just as I'd seen in Anna's blog and in hundred's of Instagram posts! Almost directly behind it was the wonderful homestay that would be my base for the month.
  </p>
  <img src="/images/yoga_7.jpg" alt="yoga" />
  <p>
    The next day we arrived at the shala and started to get to know each other.  There was an initial yoga session, marking our mats and lots of fun games to learn each others names and backgrounds.  In total we were about 20 people - I was one of the oldest and the only man. I was made to feel super welcome especially by the teachers who came over and told me that they were so grateful that I was there as they found some masculine presence helped balance the energy of the group.
  </p>

  <p> We settled into our rhythm - 7.30am start, 90 mins of learning meditation, breathing and cleansing rituals.  Then a two hour yoga practice followed by two hours for lunch.  The afternoon would kick off with a two hour lecture on all aspects of yoga.  A short break with snacks on the beach followed by a one hour workshop and then a final one hour yoga session.
  </p>
  <p>
    We kept to this schedule with small tweaks and changes throughout the course with only one day off a week.  I'd had visions of having lots of time to read, contemplate life and explore.  In reality when we finished up for the day we were exhausted.  There was the opportunity for further practice after the day finished - but after a few attempts at some trickier poses the sea beckoned.  A quick dip, some Instagram photo shoots, a quick shower and then out for dinner with some of the group. Post dinner bed and a full nights sleep.
  </p>

  <h3>The eight limbs of yoga</h3>
  <p>
   In London I'm so used to mainly focussing on the physical practice but this course covered all the eight limbs of yoga. These range from guidelines on how you interact with others, how to live a good life, cleansing practices, meditation as well as the physical asanas. Lots of this was new to me and I tried to keep an open mind to all these new elements.  There's lots to take in but plenty of fun along the way such as each morning rolling up our shirts and trying to make waves in our belly or squirting water through our nostrils. There were also contemplative and serious moments including a very powerful 24h vow of silence.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an Ashtanga course which focuses on a set routine which is practiced in the same way all round the world and is very much setup for self practice - one of my main aims.  We also got to experience a whole range of different types of yoga from powerful rocket yoga through to blissful yin yoga.
  </p>
  <p>There were also sessions ranging from learning about anatomy  through to how to teach classes, setup your own studio, manage marketing and insurance and warnings of protecting your physical and mental well being</p>

  <p>
  A highlight for me was the week we had afternoon lectures from a philosophy teacher.  A lifetime of experience and an interesting history including being a professional Indian footballer Dr Ganesh was a mesmerising presence and so engaging.  He took us through the history and philosophy of yoga and discussed in more detail some of the cleansing rituals we'd been practicing.  This was all new to me and absolutely fascinating.
  </p>
  <p>
    It all sounds so amazing but there were challenging parts.  The physical practice is tough and you had to know when to back off and not push through pain or sore muscles. There were no seats - sitting on the floor through afternoon lectures was a challenge  It was hot - we sweated non stop throughout the course. The food was great but people got the odd bit of Bali belly.  It's a remote island which meant lots of insects and other animals including jelly fish.

<h3>Teachers</h3>
<p>
  The course was incredibly well run. A huge thank you to the wonderful teachers who managed to combined humour, grace and knowledge to help us all progress as well as having fun along the way.  Marcela filled the shala with her elegance, flowing limbs and authority. Camilla was a beautiful, joyful angel with the most amazing experiences who was happy maneuvering me into a bridge with as many props as possible. My birthday buddy Kholisma was a wonderful model, amazing teacher and blessed with a beautiful voice. Her singing accompanied by Joel's guitar playing was blissful. Finally Joel - was so good for me to have another yang energy in the group who also had broad shoulders and tight hips - he was an inspiration and I'm still jealous of his glistening abs.

<h3>The Students</h3>
<p>
  The group was amazing - we formed a fantastic bond during hours of sweating, bending, overcoming physical and mental blocks, eating together, swimming, chatting and sharing our space, our lives and our thoughts. Everyone was an inspiration and joy to be around: the belly wiggling, catching an eye across the room and giggling, those who flew into handstands, or twisted them selves in knots, the wise thoughts and book recommendations, the ridiculous lion's breath, stunning Instagram poses, walking in silence and looking at the stars on the beach, late night swims, the challenges people had overcome to be there and the challenges and new experiences they conquered, the public speaking, the switching from fear and worry to glowing and joy, the belief that you could see well up and grow in everyone. Thank you to everyone for making me feel so happy and welcome.
</p>

<h3>Everything else</h3>
<p>
  Energy ebbed and flowed, the group found it's rhythm.  We had amazing lunches out on the beach. One day off a week to either laze around or jump on mopeds and explore the island.  We made friends with the people running the restaurants, only found the luxury ice cream place near the end of our time there.  We had one on one sessions with the teachers to get the most of our time.  Afternoon tea break was a welcome pause in the days proceedings - the best breaks were when we had freshly made pancakes.  There was the graduation party, the graduation ceremony, 108 sun salutations and sitting in a big sweaty hug chanting om.  So many experiences well out of my comfort zone, so different from every day life and such wonderful moments.  My hope was to carry some of that fantasy world back to normal life.  Because the rest of 2020 was set to be just normal life right...
</p>


<h3>Post course</h3>
<p>
  Back to London with stronger arms, tight legs, bronzed skin and a more spiritual outlook and into a new job.  After a week or two I went to a yoga class - the first one was all over the place - where was my shala, my crew, my teachers?  But soon was back in the flow - my body was leaner, stronger, fitter.  I could focus more. Work was going well, my yoga was great and a small group of us from the course who had got on particularly well and all lived in Europe were planning to meet. I wasn't planning on teaching as the course was for my practice but my friend Elena has persuaded me to teach yoga on her fitness retreat. And then corona virus.
</p>
<p>
  The virus has hit everyone - it felt very lucky to have got a months travel in at the start of the year as it looks like holidays might not be possible.  The retreat I was going to teach on got cancelled. Yoga has been a big help and have been able to self practice during lock down.  It's been great connecting with our group on Instagram or messaging for support.  Although it's been tougher for our small group that formed a close collection - we were European base, slightly older, generally in the same accommodation and had plans to cement our relationship by meeting up post course.  We'd been messaging a lot when first back but the virus put us all under stress - we were all dealing with personal situations and the different phases of lock down. I can't wait for this to be over and for us to reconnect properly - we've found it hard and I feel bad that we've struggled to be as close as we thought. Such special bonds forged in a fantasy world in January and I hope we can overcome the obstacles and harsh world reality 2020 has thrown at us.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
  It was a brilliant month in Bali. I got everything I wanted out of it - stronger, slightly more flexible (although that takes years to see big improvements).  I was open to learning more about the spiritual side of yoga it surprised me with how much I enjoyed and engaged with that aspect of yoga practice. The teachers made the whole experience special and they have given me a solid base for my own practice and the confidence and skills to go out and teach if I want. I want to say than you to them, to All Yoga and to all my fellow classmates who made that month so special.  Love seeing you all online and hope to meet some of you soon.  Such stunning memories and experiences.
