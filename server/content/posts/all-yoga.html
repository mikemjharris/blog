  January 2020 I spent a month in Bali - most of that time was spent completing my 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training course with All Yoga.  I wanted to write a few words as a memento for myself as well as providing thoughts and information for anyone out there who might be thinking of completing something similar.

<h3>My history with Yoga</h3>
<p>
   How did I end up at a month long yoga course?  I took up yoga in 2007 after losing my job in the financial crisis.  I'd had some serious injuries running my first marathon and wanted to do another without breaking myself.  Yoga helped me with that and I've stuck with it ever since.  My relationship with it has mainly been a physical practice - over the years it's been both a joy and a chore.  Sometimes it's felt hard to fit in, others I can't wait for my next class.  It started out as an aid to running but has become an interest in itself.

  A few years ago I thought after many years of paying for classes I'd be able to do self practice.  As I wrote in that year's <a>summar</a> I stuggled to do enough sessions.  Some of that is having your own energy to push yourself to do a whole class but some was a lack of knowledge of how to structure or man;
