  In January 2020 I spent a month there attending a 200h yoga teacher training course with <a href="https://www.allyogatraining.com/">All Yoga</a>. It was a fantastic, magical time. This blog post is partly a memento for me as to what I got up to but I also hope it will be useful for any aspiring yoga students who are looking into furter training.
  <p>
<p>
  Here's a pic of the wonderful people I got to spend a month with on a remote island - but what was my history with yoga, how did I choose this course and how did I find it?

<h3>My history with Yoga</h3>
<p>
  After a few years of running injuries and finding myself with time on my hands in 2007 after being made redundant I decided to try out yoga. Since then it's been part of my life - sometimes a joy to do, sometimes a chore.  There have been many benefits with the key one being that when I practice regularly I don't get running injuries. Most of my sessions have been part of led classes and for the most part I've been focussed on the physical practice of yoga.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the many reasons for wanting to do a teacher training course including wanting a to be stronger and more flexib, being able to put together and practice my own session and also to get more of an understanding of the history and more spirtual parts of yoga.

<h3>Choosing a yoga teacher training </h3>
<p>
  Doing a teacher training has been on my mind for a while - I almost did one between jobs in 2016 but didn't have enough time. I did end up in Chiang Mai in Thailand and attended a few sessions. The atmosphere was amazing but I missed was being by the sea.
</p>
<p>
  My yoga teacher's in London were great in suggesting a number of places with one of my faviourite teachers suggesting Radiantly Alive in Ubud, Bali.
</p>
<p>
  In the end I was quite restricited in terms of dates - I had negotiated the whole of January off between jobs . After extensive googling I found out about All Yoga. <a href="https://www.global-gallivanting.com/my-experience-at-all-yoga-teacher-training-in-bali/">This blog post by a previous attendee</a> was incredibly helpful - Anna is an excellent writer and that post is pretty much idential to my experience!. It sounded great, I got the sea, an amazing location the dates fitted perfectly.
</p>
<h3>Instagram Spying</h3>
<p>
  I started following All Yoga on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/allyogatraining/">instagram</a> and from there a nubmer of the teachers and students.  Turns out most of my future classmates were doing the same.  You're never 100% sure what you are getting when you sign up to somehting you've only seen online on a website but being able to remotely be part of another classes journey helped understand that this was the real thing.  It also helped to me to realise that this would be rewarding but hard work!
</p>

<h3>Ten Days in Ubud</h3>
  <p>
    At the end of 2019 I finished my previous job, enjoyed Christmas at home then headed to Ubud to meet up with a couple of friends. There were ten days before the training started and this allowed me to see in the New Year, get over jet lag and explore the yoga options in Ubud.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ten years previously I'd visited Ubud and since then it has got much beigger and more crowded.  I attended a couple of sessions at Radiantly Alive which were brilliant but I was glad I wasn't staying in town for the month. The best class was a morning Kunalini class at Yoga Barn - my friend Elena persuaded me to join. It's a much more spiritual class than what I was used to including my first chanting experienace.  This was the most spirtual class I'd ever been to and I loved it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The time in Ubud was great preparation for the 200h training - I got to shake of the jet lag, get used to the climate and diet and start warming up with a few yoga classes. Happy and bronzed I was ready for the next step - a boat out to the remote island of Nusa Lembongan off the East of Bali.
  </p>

  <h3>YTT on Nusa Lembongan</h3>
  <p>
    Arriving on the beach was quite surreal:  there was the yoga shala just as I'd seen in Anna's blog and in hundred's of instagram posts! Almost directly behind it was the wonderful homestay that would be my base for the month.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day we arrived at the shala and started to get to know each other.  There was an initial yoga session, marking our mats and lots of fun games to learn each others names and backgrounds.  In total we were about 20 people - I was one of the oldest and the only man. I was made to feel super welcome esepcially by the teachers who came over and told me that they were so grateful that I was there as they found some masculine prescence helped balance the energy of the group.
  </p>

  <p> We settled into our rhythem - 7.30am start, 90 mins of learning meditation, breathing and cleansing rituals.  Then a two hour yoga practice followed by two hours for lunch.  The afternoon would kick off with a two hour lecture on all aspects of yoga.  A short break with snacks on the beach followed by a one hour workshop and then a final one hour yoga session.
  </p>
  <p>
    We kept to this schedule with small tweaks and changes throughout the coure with only one day off a week.  I'd had visions of having lots of time to read, contemplate life and explore.  In reality when we finished up for the day we were exhausted.  There was the opportunity for further practice after the day finished - but after a few attempts at some trickier poses the sea beckoned.  A quick dip, some instagram photoshoots, a quick shower and then out for dinner with some of the group. Post dinner bed and a full nights sleep.
  </p>

  <h3>The eight limbs of yoga</h3>
  <p>
   In London I'm so used to mainly focussing on the physical pracitce but this course covered all the eight limbs of yoga. These range from guidlines on how you interact with others, how to live a good life, cleansing practices, meditation as well as the physical assanas. Lots of this was new to me and I tried to keep an open mind to all these new elements.  There's lots to take in but plenty of fun along the way such as each morning rolling up our shirts and trying to make waves in our belly or squirting water through our nostrils. There were also contemplative and serious moments including a very powerful 24h vow of silence.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is an Ashtanga course which focuses on a set routine which is pracitced in the same way all round the world and is very much setup for self pracitce - one of my main aims.  We also got to experience a whole range of different types of yoga from powerful rocket yoga through to blissful yin yoga.
  </p>
  <p>There were also sessions ranging from learning about anatomy  through to how to teach classes, setup your own studio, manage marketing and insurance and warnings of protecting your physical and mental well ebing</p>

  <p>
  A highlight for me was the week we had afternoon lectures from a philosohy teacher.  A lifetime of experience and an interesting history including being a professional indian footballer Dr Ganesh was a mesmirising presence and so engaging.  He took us through the history and philosophy of yoga and discussed in more detail some of the cleansing rituals we'd been practicing.  This was all new to me and absolutely fascinating.
  </p>
  <p>
    It all souns so amazing but there were challenging parts.  The physical pracitce is tough and you had to know when to back off and not push through pain or sore muscles.  It was hot - we sweated non stop throughout the course. The food was great but people got the odd bit of bali belly.  It's a remote island which meant lots of insects and other animals including jelly fish.

<h3>Teachers</h3>
<p>
  The course was incredibly well run. A huge thank you to the wonderful teachers who managed to combined humour, grace and knowledge to help us all progress as well as having fun along the way.  Marcela filled the shala with her elegance, flowing limbs and authority. Camilla was a beautiful, joyful angel with the most amazing experiences who was happy manouvering me into a bridge with as many props as possible. My birthday buddy Kholisma was a wonderful model, amazing teacher and blessed with a beautiful voice. Her singing accompanied by Joel's guitar playing was blissful. FInally Joel - was so good for me to have another yang energy in the group who also had broad sholders and tight hips - he was an inspiration and I'm still jealous of his glistening abs.

<h3>The Students</h3>
<p>
  The group was amazing - we formed a fantastic bond during hours of sweating, bending, overcomming physical and mental blocks, eating together, swimming, chatting and sharing our space, our lives and our thoughts. Everyone was an inspiration and joy to be around: the belly wiggling, catching an eye across the room and giggling, those who flew into handstands, or twisted them selves in knots, the wise thoughts and book recommendations, the ridiculous lion's breath, stunning instagram poses, the challenges people had overcome to be there and the challenges and new experiences they conquered, the public speaking, the switching from fear and worry to glowing and joy, the belief that you could see well up and grow in everyone. Thank you to everyone for making me feel so happy and welcome.

<p>
      FInally to my European group.  The whole group got on amazingily well but there was a small group of us who were slightly older and european.  We were there for a month or just over and had jobs to go back to.  We ended up spending most of the free time together and we had so many special evenings and moments.  They helped make the month so special, we opened up and learnt so much about each other and got to laugh and rely on each other.  We all grew and it was fantastic to see each of us learn from each other and grow and expand.  The changes
  </p>


<h3>YTT</h3>
<p>
   We all learnt so much.  I mainly went along to improve my own practice which I did - I also loved teaching the yoga nad was fascinated by the yoga philosophy sessions.  We taught on the final sunday and then had a few days where we tried other yoga techniques and also managed our own morning ritual of cleansing, brething and meditiation.  THe aim was to set up to return to the real world.  Having 4.5h while away on a training course is reasonalbe but hard to fit into every day life.  B

   <p>
      Back in London I was straight back into a job - I was jealous of those who managed another week or two to unwind in Bali and would highly recommend that if you have the time and money.  For the first month back (february) i allowed myself some time to get back into things - the first few yoga sessions back felt really strange but after a week my body had had a chance to recover and benefit from the intence january training. Everything was better and I only really appreciated then how much I'd improved, how much stronger and toned I was.  Managed some of the breathing and cleansing rituals but on an ad hoc basis.  When in London running is my meditaion equivalent and got back into that.  I'd love to have a more regular meditation pracitce but find that running gives me most of the benefits and there isn't enough time in the week to fit it all in.   Happy to have the skills and knowledge for a future date.

    Corona virus was just rearing it's head as we left Bali - face masks were sold out for our trip home.  OUr group split into different places and we kept up with each other - one of our team was in Milan which was hit first by the virus - the trauma of being at home and wtih the news cycle put pressure on the new friendships we had especially as differnt places were impacted at differnt times. We had plans to catch up in Italy or Paris but those have been put on hold.  We're all dealing with stresses and concerns we have and the fantasy world of Bali feels such a long way away. One day we'll all be able to meet up and share our memories of ginger tea on the beach, of mice in beds, of smiling, laughing, ice cream eating etc.
