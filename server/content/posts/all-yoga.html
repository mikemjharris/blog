  January 2020 I spent a month in Bali - most of that time was spent completing my 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training course with All Yoga.  I wanted to write a few words as a memento for myself as well as providing thoughts and information for anyone out there who might be thinking of completing something similar. Here's a pic of the wonderful people I got to spend a month with on a remote island - but what was my history with yoga, how did I choose this course and how did I find it?

<h3>My history with Yoga</h3>
<p>
  How did I end up at a month long yoga course?  I took up yoga in 2007 after losing my job in the financial crisis.  I'd had some serious injuries running my first marathon and wanted to do another without breaking myself.  Yoga helped me with that and I've stuck with it ever since.  My relationship with it has mainly been a physical practice - over the years it's been both a joy and a chore.  Sometimes it's felt hard to fit in, others I can't wait for my next class.  It started out as an aid to running but has become an interest in itself.
</p>
<p>
  A few years ago I thought after many years of paying for classes I'd be able to do self practice.  As I wrote in that year's <a href="/posts/2018-retro">summary</a> I stuggled to do enough sessions.  Part of wanting to do a teacher training was to have a solid understanding of the structures of a class to be able to put together my own session, also to learn a bit more about the other parts of yoga.  I'd done a bit of breath work before but didn't know much about the history of yoga and had completely avoided the more spirtual aspect.

<h3>Choosing a yoga teacher training </h3>
<p>
  I'd planned on doinga teacher training for a while - I almost did one between jobs in 2016 but didn't have enough time - I did end up in Chiang Mai in Thailand and did a few sessions there and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  One I missed was being by the sea - if I was taking month our of work I wanted to be by the ocean if possible.  If I didn't get on with the yoga I could always enjoy the water.
</p>
<p>
  My yoga teacher's in London have been great in recommending places to do the training and on their recommendation I was planning on going to Radiantly Alive in Ubud, Bali.  having been to bali ten years before I knew I liked it and Ubud seems the centre of yoga there however was cautious as felt it was quite busy and no ocean.
</p>
<p>
  In the end I was quite restricited in terms of dates - I had negotiated the whole of January off inbetween jobs which didn't fit in with Radiantly Alive.  After extensive google I foudn out about all yoga, I also read <a href="https://www.global-gallivanting.com/my-experience-at-all-yoga-teacher-training-in-bali/">this blog post by a previous attendee</a> (Anna is an excellent writer and that post is pretty much idential to my experience! Anna got invited to the course - I didn't get anything from All yoga for writing this apart from a brilliant few weeks!).  It sounded great, I got the sea, the location seemed nice and remote and the dates fitted perfectly.  It seemd serious but not over the top.  I started following all yoga on instagram and from there a nubmer of the teachers adn students.  Turns out most of my future classmates were doing the same.  You're never sure what you are getting when you sign up to these things but spying on a class over the course of a month on social media meant you got a fantastic idea of what's to come.  Excited I booked in my slot, sorted flights, asked for a yoga mat for christmas (recommend corgk yogi mats).  December was super busy finishing of my previous job and a break was just what I needed.

  <h3>Ten Days in Ubud</h3>
  <img src="/images/yoga_barn.jpg" alt="yoga" />
  <p>
    In late Decemeber I arrived in Bali and headed to Ubud to meet up with a couple of firend (Maria and Elena) who happened to be there too.  I had bout ten days before the training started and this allowed me to see in the New Year, get over jet lag and explore the yoga options in Ubud.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ubud has grown so much in ten years and the amount of traffic and size of it now was definitely a detraction. Howeer once in the sanctury of yoga barn or radiatnely alive you felt well away from everything.  Both are big esttablishments with classes of 70+. Most of the yoga in London that I've attended but elena persuaded me join a kundalini class - it was amazing and was a great way to open myself up to other aspects of yoga practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    having that time in ubud was great - got to do a bunch of yoga, experiencnce the jungle and tick off a few of the must sees.  After a week I was excited to be getting a boat to Nuse Lembongan, a remote island off the east coast of bali where the teadcher training was going to take place.
  </p>

  <h3>YTT on Nusa Lembongan</h3>

  <p>
    arriving on the beach was quite surreal as there was the yoga shala that i'd been viewing on instagram for months! directly behind it was the wonderful homestay that would be my base for the month.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next day we arrived at the shala and started to get to know each other.  There was an initial yoga session, marking our mats and lots of fun games to learn eachothers names and backgrounds.  In total we were about 20 people - I was one of the oldest and the only man. I was made to feel super welcome esepcially by the teachers who came over and told me not to worry about not being a woman and that they were so grateful as they found some masculine prescence helped balance the energy of the group.
  </p>

  <p> We settled into our rhythem - 7.30am start, 90 mins of learning meditation, breathing and cleansing rituals.  Then a two hour yoga practice followed by two hours for lunch.  The afternoon would kick off with a two hour lecture on all aspects of yoga.  A short break with snacks on the beach followed by a one hour workshop and then a final one hour yoga session.
  </p>
  <p>
    We kept to this schedule with small tweaks and changes throughout the coure with only one day off a week.  I'd had visions of having lots oftime to read, contemplate life and explore.  In reality when we finished up for the day we were pretty exhausted.  There was the opportunity for further practice after the day finished - I'd imagined doing on my inversions but in reality was tired so ended up having a dip in the sea and heping out taking pics for peoples instagram.  A quick shower, meeting up with some of the group for dinner, some delicious, chepa balinese food and then pretty much straight to be.
  </p>

  <h3>The (physical) yoga</h3>
  <p>
    The course was focussed on ashtanga - the full primary series is two hours long and a set sequence.  We would be learning and teaching a shorter one hour version of this.  We got to try out other forms of yoga too but ashtange was the basis.  It was tough - physically and mentally!  I got a lot stronger through the four weeks and the workshps inmporve my postures.  Some improvements felt so much better, sometimes though you are in a better position but it is toughter or feels weird.  I'd wanted to improve how I move to breathing and got a lot better throughout - although it needed constant focus.  There was always a balance between pushing yourself a bit to get better, stronger, longer whilst not geting injureies.  I got sore writsts from all the vinyasas.  Ashtanga primary also focusses on the hamstrings and they were quite sore and often tighter than at the start of the month due to all the practice! Manage to balance my flow and put in anything ranging from 30% to 100% effort depending on my physical or mental state.  There's was a mixture in the class with a few peole having to sit out for a few days either with physical tweaks or form bali belly.

  </p>
  <h3>All the yoga</h3>

  <p>
    Part of the course was learning all about the other parts (or limbs) of yoga.  My experience in London has mainly been on the physical practice but yoga also encompasses ways of acting, how you treat others, cleansing and breathing techniques.  The physical yoga is to prepare the body for sitting for long periods and meditating.  It was fascinating understanding where these pracitces came from, the reasoning and logic behind them and also having the time, space and energy to engage in them.  We spent mornings with our tops half up rolling our bellies trying to perfect a gut cleanins technique, with our hands over our faces humming like bees, pinching our noses, staring intho each others eyes, gazing into space, wondering along the beach, pouring water into our nostrils and sitting in blissful silence.  All things I haven't engaged with in the past but being away from reality with the time to learn and focus and with a group all wanting to try out these practices it felt so natural.  Some made more sense than others but the main takeaway was to try them all, practice over a long time and see what works best for you.
  </p>
  <p>There were also sessions ranging from learning about anatomy (interesting but a tough topic especially to teach in a hot afternoon agter lunch) through to how to teach classes, setup your own studio, manage marketing and insurance and warnings of protecting your physical and mental well ebing
  </p>
  <p>
  A highlight for me was the week we had afternoon lectures from a philosohy teacher.  A lifetime of experience and an interesting history including being a professional indian footballer Dr Ganesh was a mesmirising presence and so engaging.  He took us through the history and philosophy of yoga and discussed in more detail some of the cleansing rituals we'd been practicing.  So many new things to learn and understand.
</p>

<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>
   The reason for being there was to learn to be a yoga teacher.  The course was very well run and structured.  IT reminded me quite a bit of the intensive coding course I did back in 2014 - along with the comradere of the group but also the ebb and flow of the energy.  THere is always a pattern to how groups respond to these intensive learning sessions and it was clear that all yoga had learnt from running the course many times.  They had a suprise or a break at the right periods in the week when enerygy was low.  They gave us just the right amount of info for us to engage with but kept things that might worry us such as tests and exams as secretes until they were needed.  The balance of energy and understanding from the group of teachers was brilliant.
</p>
<h3>Teachers</h3>
<p>
  A huge thank you to the wonderful teachers who managed to combined humour, grace and knowledge to help us all progress as well as having fun along the way.  Marcela filled the shala with her elegance, beautiful flow and authority. She strode around like an amazonian godess. I was convinced she was at least 7ft tall and was so suprised at the end of the trip when we had a big hug and she fitted under my armpit. Camilla was a beautiful, joyful angel with the most amazing experiences. She was determined to improve my bridge and spent most of the course wrapping straps around me to wrench me into position.  Thank you for taking me freediving, for not laughing too much at me hyperventilating into a bean bag and for respecting my head massage demands!  My birthday buddy Kholisma was a wonderful model, amazing teacher (we had not idea at the time but we got to experience her first full primary series teaching and it was brilliant) and lightful spirit.  Her singing along accompanies by Joel's guitar playing was blissful. FInally Joel - was so good for me to have another yang enery in the group who also had broad sholders and tight hips - he was an inspiration and I'm still jealous of his glistening abs. Thank you to all of them who made it so special.

<h3>The group</h3>
<p>
  The group was amazing and was so weloming and open with me.  Everyone had a male presence if they needed it but I tried to be restpectful of what everyone wanted. The weeks were another world and made the group feel so special. People were insipirational in their personal stories and issues they had overcome and were facing. Some were inspirational for their amazing handstand, flexibility (never try and compare yourself to professional dancers or 21y old semi professional ballet dancers). There was so much joy from expert lions breath breathers, belly wigglers, the fitness instructer who I spent the whole course giggling at across the roo, those who recommneded books and practices, the firy italian who was so real, the instagam shoots, big dinners out so much.
</p>
<p>
  A few special thanks - my neightbour opposite who was travelling alone and out of her country for the first time - inspirational and she was so trusting (or deseperate) to invite me over the first night to try and track down a lost cockroach. To the firey Italian who was the such fun but so much her own truthful person. SIngpore buddy who books.

  <p>
      FInally to my European group.  The whole group got on amazingily well but there was a small group of us who were slightly older and european.  We were there for a month or just over and had jobs to go back to.  We ended up spending most of the free time together and we had so many special evenings and moments.  They helped make the month so special, we opened up and learnt so much about each other and got to laugh and rely on each other.  We all grew and it was fantastic to see each of us learn from each other and grow and expand.  The changes
  </p>


<h3>YTT</h3>
<p>
   We all learnt so much.  I mainly went along to improve my own practice which I did - I also loved teaching the yoga nad was fascinated by the yoga philosophy sessions.  We taught on the final sunday and then had a few days where we tried other yoga techniques and also managed our own morning ritual of cleansing, brething and meditiation.  THe aim was to set up to return to the real world.  Having 4.5h while away on a training course is reasonalbe but hard to fit into every day life.  B

   <p>
      Back in London I was straight back into a job - I was jealous of those who managed another week or two to unwind in Bali and would highly recommend that if you have the time and money.  For the first month back (february) i allowed myself some time to get back into things - the first few yoga sessions back felt really strange but after a week my body had had a chance to recover and benefit from the intence january training. Everything was better and I only really appreciated then how much I'd improved, how much stronger and toned I was.  Managed some of the breathing and cleansing rituals but on an ad hoc basis.  When in London running is my meditaion equivalent and got back into that.  I'd love to have a more regular meditation pracitce but find that running gives me most of the benefits and there isn't enough time in the week to fit it all in.   Happy to have the skills and knowledge for a future date.

    Corona virus was just rearing it's head as we left Bali - face masks were sold out for our trip home.  OUr group split into different places and we kept up with each other - one of our team was in Milan which was hit first by the virus - the trauma of being at home and wtih the news cycle put pressure on the new friendships we had especially as differnt places were impacted at differnt times. We had plans to catch up in Italy or Paris but those have been put on hold.  We're all dealing with stresses and concerns we have and the fantasy world of Bali feels such a long way away. One day we'll all be able to meet up and share our memories of ginger tea on the beach, of mice in beds, of smiling, laughing, ice cream eating etc.
