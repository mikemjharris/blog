  A number of technical people who I respect on twitter are quite vocal that blogs should have an RSS feed. After sitting on my todo list for a while this week I'm excited to announce that my blog too has an RSS feed! Here is a link to: <a href="/rss.xm">My RSS Feed</a>. The rest of the post includes a few words on what RSS is and how I added it to my blog.

<h4>Definitiion of done</h4>

  Those two tweets described what I needed to build pretty succintly:  create an RSS feed, provide the whole post in the feed and make sure there is a link to the feed on the site.
