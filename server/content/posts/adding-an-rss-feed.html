  A number of technical people who I respect on twitter are quite vocal that blogs should have an RSS feed. After sitting on my todo list for a while this week I'm excited to announce that my blog too has an RSS feed! Here is a link to: <a href="/rss.xm">My RSS Feed</a>. The rest of the post includes a few words on what RSS is and how I added it to my blog.

<h4>Definitiion of done</h4>
<p>
  Those two tweets described what I needed to build pretty succintly:  create an RSS feed, provide the whole post in the feed and make sure there is a link to the feed on my blog.  But first what is an RSS feed and how do I add on to a blog?
 </p>

 <h4>RSS</h4>
 <p>
   RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. It's a standard, xml based way of exposing your blog content so that it can be read in a RSS reader.  Users out there can follow the blogs they want and have one central place to see that latest output of their favourite writers.
 </p>
 <p>
  For someone writing a blog there's more chance that someone will discover and read what you wrote.  One downside is that if you rely on advertising or really care about data on how many people read your blog then providing all the content in the RSS feed this means that users wont travel to your site.  Neither of these matter to me so more than happy to provide a feed.
 </p>
 <h4>Adding an RSS feed</h4>
 <p>
   Most bloggin platforms (medium, wordpress etc.) either have RSS feed capability built in or available as a plugin.  My blog is a beautiful handcrafted piece of code (or cobled together bunch of JS libraries depending on your outlook) and as such adding an RSS feed was a manual process.  Fortunatly I provide a list of all the posts in the blog as JSON via an endpoint so creating an RSS feed meant mapping those fields to the required ones, adding in some header content and converting it to xml. For that process I used https://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js and you can see the relevant piece of code: <a href="https://github.com/mikemjharris/blog/blob/56c57ab5f94e1bb7e6d6fff5c8de364b75b81aba/server/routes/main.js#L60-L92">on github</a> Here's pic of the feed and you can also see it in action <a href="/rss.xml">here</a>
