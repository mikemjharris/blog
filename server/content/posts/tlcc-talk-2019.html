<p>
  In August 2019 I was part of a panel at the Tessitura Community Community conference.  Here's a write up of the context, the preparation and the talk itself.
</p>

<h4>Tessi... what?</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.tessituranetwork.com/" target="_blank">Tessitura</a> is a  "Unified system to run your arts and culture organization".  They have over 600 institutions all over the world using their system which manages everything from ticketing, CRM, finance, analytics and so much more. They are a not for profit and organise a large US based conference each year called Tessitura Learning and Community Conference (TLCC). This year was the biggest ever, with almost 2000 attendees. I'd had a proposal accepted and was set to be part of a presentation discussing the different ways organisations have adapted the Tessitura white label ticketing site.

<h4>Community</h4>
<p>
  One of the best parts of Tessitura is getting to mix with a wide variety of other organisations. I was doing a ten minute slot in an hour talk alongside four others and the preparation for the talk and conference itself was mainly organised by community members. As a group we had our first online discussion at the end of May.  We outlined the topics we wanted to cover and how our session would work. We had a follow up run through at the start of July and sent in our presentations by mid July. A huge thanks to  Sydney Peloquin (Austin Theatre) Lilly Pipkin (Ballet Austin) and Luke McKenzie (Perot Museum) for helping corral, prod and generally make sure we had everything we needed and were on time! Here's a pic of the full panel line up:

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>
  In a couple of previous posts (<a href="/posts/burlesque-presentation">Burlesque presentation</a> and <a href="posts/tools-and-tips-for-presenting">tools and tips for presentation</a>) I've discussed how I structure, prepare and deliver a talk.  Those posts are a few years old - but I still broadly follow my advice from then. Getting slides sorted far in front of the presentation was a big relief. However I often practice the talk as I build the slides - mentally I felt I was done so left practicing the talk quite late. Fortunately it's an area I've discussed extensively in many situations so was pretty comfortable with the message and the key points I wanted to make.

<h4>On the day prep</h4>

<p>The conference is four days and our talk was the first talk on the developer track after the opening key note.  Earlier in the day I'd made sure I'd found the room (the conference centre was huuuge) and stood on the stand so I could visualise how the talk would go. Then I could enjoy the keynote knowing I was all prepped. Post keynote went directly to the room, met the other presenters in the flesh for the first time and sat down on stage at the front of the room.
