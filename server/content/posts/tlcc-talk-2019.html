<p>
  In August 2019 I was part of a pannel at the Tessitura Community Community conference.  As usual with talks I give here's a write up of the contect, the preparation and the talk itself.
</p>

<h4>Tessi... what?</h4>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.tessituranetwork.com/" target="_blank">Tessitura</a> is a  "Unified system to run your arts and culture organization".  They have over 600 institutions all over the world using their system which manages everything from ticket sales both in the gallery and online, CRM, finance, analytics and so much more. They are a not for profit and organise a large US based conference each year called Tessitura Learning and Community Conference (TLCC). This year was the biggest ever, with almost 2000 attendess. I'd had a propsal accepted and was set to be part of a presentation discussing the different ways organisations have adapted the tessitura white label ticketing site.

<h4>Community</h4>
<p>
  One of the best parts of Tessitura is getting to mix with a wide variety of other organisations. I was doing a ten minute slot in an hour talk alongside four others and the preparation for the talk and confernce itself was mainly organised by community members. As a group we had our first online discussion at the end of May.  We outlined the topics we wanted to cover and how our session would work. We had a follow up run through at the start of July and sent in our presentations by mid July. A huge thanks to  Sydney Peloquin (Austin Theatre) Lilly Pipkin (Ballet Austin) and Luke McKenzie (Perot Museum) for helping corral, prod and generally make sure we had everything we needed and were on time!

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>
  In a couple of previous posts (xx and xxx) i've discussed how I structure, prepare and deliver a talk.  Pretty much all of those points ring true.  Getting slides sorted far in front of the presentation was a big relief. The only knock on effect was I felt as the slides were finished that I was all done which meant I didn't practice the talk as much as usual. The topic and have talked around all the points in my presentation a number of times over the past year.

  My talk proposal had been accepted - I was to have a ten minute slot alongside a number of other organisations where we all discussed different parts of our website setup.
