<p>
  In August 2019 I was part of a panel at the Tessitura Community Community conference.  Here's a write up of the context, the preparation and the talk itself.
</p>

<h4>Tessi... what?</h4>
<p>
  For those not in the arts world <a href="https://www.tessituranetwork.com/" target="_blank">Tessitura</a> is a  "Unified system to run your arts and culture organization".  They have over 600 institutions all over the world using their system which manages everything from ticketing, CRM, finance, analytics and so much more. They are a not for profit and organise a large US based conference each year called Tessitura Learning and Community Conference (TLCC). This year was the biggest ever, with almost 2000 attendees. I'd had a proposal accepted and was set to be part of a presentation discussing the different ways organisations have adapted the Tessitura white label ticketing site.

<h4>Community</h4>
<p>
  One of the best parts of Tessitura is getting to mix with a wide variety of other organisations. I was doing a ten minute slot in an hour talk alongside four others and the preparation for the talk and conference itself was mainly organised by community members. As a group we had our first online discussion at the end of May.  We outlined the topics we wanted to cover and how our session would work. We had a follow up run through at the start of July and sent in our presentations by mid July. A huge thanks to  Sydney Peloquin (Austin Theatre) Lilly Pipkin (Ballet Austin) and Luke McKenzie (Perot Museum) for helping corral, prod and generally make sure we had everything we needed and were on time! Here's a pic of the full panel line up:

<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>
  In a couple of previous posts (<a href="/posts/burlesque-presentation">Burlesque presentation</a> and <a href="posts/tools-and-tips-for-presenting">tools and tips for presentation</a>) I've discussed how I structure, prepare and deliver a talk.  Those posts are a few years old - but I still broadly follow my advice from then. Getting slides sorted far in front of the presentation was a big relief. However I often practice the talk as I build the slides - mentally I felt I was done so left practicing the talk quite late. Fortunately it's an area I've discussed extensively in many situations so was pretty comfortable with the message and the key points I wanted to make.

<h4>On the day prep</h4>

<p>The conference is four days and our talk was the first talk on the developer track after the opening key note.  Earlier in the day I'd made sure I'd found the room where we'd be presenting (the conference centre was huuuge) and stood on the stand so I could visualise how the talk would go. Then I could enjoy the keynote knowing I was all prepped. Post keynote headed off promptly, met the other presenters in the flesh for the first time and made myself comfortable on my chair on stage.
</p>
<h4>Talk</h4>
<p>
  My talk was the second from last so I could sit back and enjoy the others talks.  We'd done a prep run through a few weeks earlier but a few things had changed and everyone was much more polished. Unfortunately the speakers couldn't see the screen showing the slides to the audience which made it a bit harder to follow along. Definitely lost attention for some of the talks as I briefly went over the key parts for my talk. Really enjoyed my section - always a bit tough presenting from someone else's computer but that went smoothly.  The room itself was much quite short but very wide so had to make a big effort to try and talk to both sides to include everyone. All went smoothly - usually there's a two second bit in the middle of talk where I get the weird feeling of being in a very weird, surrel scenario. A breif pause and a sip of water and a mental reminder to myself to talk slower and usually back on track with no discernable break.
</p>
<h4>Feedback</h4>
<p>
  There was only a short time available for questions at the end and with a broad range of topics covered there wasn't anything focused on my section.  There were a few people who came up immediately after with a few thoughts. The benefits of a four day conference and talking at the beginning meant there was plenty more time to bump into people. Over the next few days got to have a bunch of interesting chats as well as some good feedback on the talk and some tips.
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
  Really enjoyed the whole process - great to be part of a community driven talk prep.  Was the earliest I'd got my slides prepared for a talk ever.  Just need to remember next time, especially if it's a longer or trickier talk that I need to still practice post handing in slides!  Really enjoyed the talk itself and got some excellent feedback. Maninly really happy to show off lots of the hardwork the team has put in to building a fantastic ticketing site!
