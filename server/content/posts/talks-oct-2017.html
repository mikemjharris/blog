<p>
  October 2017 was fairly busy in terms of talks - I presented at two different meetups with two completely different talks. The first was more techical about Progressive Web Apps and the second was around softer skills and team structure. There was the usual stress related in preparing for a talk, the buzz of doing it and the relief after when they were all finished. Links here to the talks, some related topics I bring up in the talks as well as a few tips on how to go about talking at meetups.

<h4>People, Processes and ADRs</h4>
<p>
  A month of so back I saw a request for talks at the REACT meetup.  I've only been once as it's super hard to get tickets so thought this would be a way to guarantee entry.  I messaged the organisers with some broad ideas about a talk and after a short back and forth had to come up with a title. The topics for the talk had been washing away around in my head for a while but having to make a quick decision was really helpful.  The meetup is at the facebook offices and the AV setup there was fantastic.  Chatting to the person in charge of the setup was super interesting as they have helped on the technical aspects of loads of FB events all over Europe and Africa. Talk went well and got good feedback especially on the last topic of ADRs.  What are those I hear you cry?  Well, checkout the vide here:

<h4>there's a progressive web app for that</h4>
<p>talk i did at js roundabout.  i know one of the organisers and had spoken ages ago about suggesting some topics i'd like to talk about at a meetup. it was only until recently when i built a small side project and presented it internally at moo that i actuall got back to sam.  it was very serendipidous as they needed a speaker for their next event in a couple of days.  rushed around tidying things up and making them fit with the topic. event was at skyskanners awesome new offices, there was a good crowd and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  here's the talk:

<h4>getting and prepping a talk</h4>
<p>
  For both talks I got through friends and conncetions as well as being on various lists and, most importantly, putting myself forward for them.  If you're thinking about doing a talk go for it - you need to put yourself forward though - these things don't just happen.
</p>
<p>
  My preparation for these talks (and almost all others I do) consists of writing nothing down initially but playing with ideas in my head. I live about 1h 20min walk from work - when prepping for a talk I make sure I have enough time in the mornings to walk in. Being outside and wandering through London really helps me think and allows me to flesh out the idea for the talk. I also talk to myself so if you see a strange person wandering through London Fields and mumbling to themselves that's probably me. Once i've got the start and first few sections sorted I'll put those down on some slides and repeat the process. Practice is important and I practice lots. Also I find that as I've started the talk in my head it's easier to talk on the day without notes and to sound more natural.  Also I practice. Again and again. And again. And again. It's really weird but I've found the more I practice the better the talk goes and the happier I am before during and after.

<p>
  Was happy with both talks - people are giving up their evenings to come and hear what I have to say but also to be entertained.  I make sure there are some lightheard neutral jokes as well as some interesting ideas and topics.  Got some great discussions with attendees after at both events.
