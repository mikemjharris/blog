<p>
  At the end of 2017 I moved on from MOO after just over two years to start a new job at the Royal Academy of Arts. Two months into that job I wanted to write a bit about some of the reasons for changing and how the new job has measured up so far.
</p>

<h4>Two years at MOO</h4>

<p> 
  The past two years at MOO were fantastic. For a start the environment and people was super warm, friendly and supportive. Secondly I got to work on some super interesting projects, learnt a huge amount and improved way more than I thought I would in the two years.  There was lots of change along the way with MOO growing rapidly and a huge shift in the architecture of it's tech (most notably moving from self hosted servers to AWS). I was lucky to have good managers who pushed and challenged me and rewarded me with promotions and more money along the way.
</p>

<h4>Why change?</h4>

<p>
  Two reasons - one a big braod change due to the exciting opportunities in the world and the second to develop new skills
</p>

<p>
  The opportunities in the tech world are huge - one of the reasons for changing careers to be a developerwas so that I could work in sectors that were way beyond my skillset when I worked in finance. MOO was one of those and have learnt a huge amount about both physical and digital design as well as about how a startup grows and an awful lot about business cards. In joining the RA I get to learn about the arts world, meet a whole range of new people and expose myself to a experiences that I never thought I would get. I'll probably join a more traditional tech company in the future but for now the opportunity to embed myself in a traditional arts organisation is hugely attractive.
</p>
<p>
  While the RA has a big pull the job also had to measure up. Tech jobs in the arts world don't come up that often and this one was almost a perfect fit - challenges in running a team, overseeing the full tech stack, getting to code as well as being part of bigger decisions and planning. Getting to architect solutions as well as helping grow and develop a team. 
</p>
<p>
This seemed like a perfect next step in the career path.  MOO helped me develop massively as a software engineer. This new role offered the ability to try on a number of different hats on a much smaller scale (in terms of tech)
</p>


<h4>The first few months</h4>
<p>
  The stars all aligned and the timing of my arrival at the end of Novemebr couldn't of been planned better. A year long procuremnet process for a replacement ticketing, membership and crm solution was coming to a head - I quickly got up to speed and was abe to contribute in the climax of that project. For the team joining just before Chistmas worked well - I observed how the worked delivering a big project to provide an online explorer for our digitised collection and there was the usual host of Decemeber social events.  It allowed us to catch up in a fairly relaxed manner, kick off 1-1s and help out with reviews. 
</p>

<p>
In January we all moved back to the Royal Academy buildings - most of the staff had spent the previous two years in temporary offices in Blackfriars and were excited to be back 'home'. Building work is still progressing and our team had a couple of weeks working in the General Assembly room (pictured) and are now housed in one of the galleries for a month or two until our offices are finished.  WHile discruptive it's been an awesome opportunity to work right in the heart of the RA - coming to work in the mornings through the main courtyard is breath taking.  You also get a real sense of the visitors - the first weeks of the year were quiet inbetween exhibitions but as of the past week the RA has been teeming with friends and press for the kick off of Charles I. The public will be in next week and I can't wait to see how the atmosphere changes again.
<p>

<p>
  On the work side it's been a good mix of new and familiar with challenges in learning all about the a new architecture structure. Lots of new ways of doing things to pick up and learn in the short term and work out how to iterate and improve upon in the long term. For a 250 year old organistion our team if run very much like a startup.  The team have been very welcoming and I feel I have already helped improve and guide them on a number of areas - am sure there will be bumps along the way but so far it's been going well.
  <p>

 <li>Perform an unsupported handstand</li>
 <li>Dry January</li>
 <li>Visit all of the Royal Academy's exhibitions</li>
</ul>

<h4>Perform a free standing handstand</h4>
<p>
As part of my regular yoga practice I've done handstands but always with support.  I've always wanted to do a free standing one and I hope this year I'll achieve it.  I have an idea of how to get there - mainly lengthening my hamstrings and doing lots of practice. On top of that I will probably need some help - I've got contact details to get private tuition as well as a studio that focuses on balancing. For inspiration I've been following <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ZoeJonesHandbalancer/" target="_blank">Zoe Jones - Handbalancer on Facebook</a>. Inversions here I come!
</p>
<h4>Dry January</h4>
<p>
  Being part of 'Dry January' has always felt a bit cliched and has never appealed. As I've failed to go for any significant period without booze in the past year I'm hoping being part of a 'movement' will provide me with the social support and understanding to go for a month without. I definitely drink too much and would love to see how I feel after 30 days. Cheers to that resolution!
</p>

<h4>Go to all the Royal Academy's exhibitions</h4>
<p>
 At the end of 2017 I changed jobs and started work at the Royal Academy. There were many reasons for changing jobs - mainly it was a fantastic opportunity with a challenging mix of technical skills and management. In addition to that I also wanted to learn more more about art and going to all of the exhibitions seems like a great way to go about this. The team's offices are part of the RA and we get free entry to all the exhibitions so no excuses. As part of my monthly planning I'll make sure I have the opportunity to explore the galleries.  Watch this space for how I do and what I learn. If you'd like to pop by and catch up and see what's on feel free to drop me a message.
</p>

<h4>Achieving Other life goals</h4>
<p>
As mentioned at the beginning these resolutions are clear, independent and self contained.  They are also nothing to do with my professional life or with my health and fitness. Both of those areas are too important to only reassess and set resolutions at the end of the year.  For both fitness and my career I have a range of goals and targets ranging from new skills or processes I want to learn in the next few weeks through to long term targets I'm aiming for. Generally I assess how I'm doing and readjust my aims on long walks - I make an effort to take a regular long, leisurely stroll to work and think about life, the universe and everything. Sometimes my mind whirls away on an annoying situation, or on a talk if I have one coming up and occasionally it sorts out what I need to be doing next in life. 
</p>
  
<p>
  My new work is the furthest commute I'll of ever had in London - I'm hoping I can find the energy and time to make the 2h walk across town at least once a month and make sure I get valuable thinking time as well as seeing the sights. 
</p>
<p>
 Here's hoping we all keep our resolutions!  Good luck with whatever you've committed to in 2018.
