Books. Amazing, beautiful, bewildering books. I love reading. In a <a href="/posts/accidental-sexist">previous post</a> I wrote about the unconscious unbalance in the gender of the authors of the books I've been reading. Here is a review of the variety of books I've been reading since that previous post in 2016.

<h4>Book balance</h4>

  It's becoming second nature now to have a more balanced book consumption. Having a kindle really helps - I make sure that whenever I come across a good book recommendation, and especially when that recommendation is by a non male author, I order it straight away so I always have something to hand when I finish a novel.

<h4>Beyond gender</h4>
<p> 
  While my inital focus on gender was a response to a guardian article I've also been making sure I get as wide a range of experiences as possible. That's meant reading more books by people of colour, also a wider geographical range and also those who write or indentify on different gender or sexual specturs.

  <h4>Reccomendations</h4>
  <p> I fyou are on the lookout there are good tips everywhere - these can be a bit overwhelming.  My favourite sources are the FT weekend arts section, my Hackney book club and twitter but also rely on tips from friends and the radio as well as going through some of the classics. Here's an example of some of the positive side of twitter - there's a whole range of everything on that platform and here's an example of a welath of helpful info.

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve only been reading books by women of color this year, and I&#39;ve read so many powerful and beautifully written books. Here are a few favorites from this year so far, in no particular order ðŸ“–:</p>&mdash; Adrienne Domingus (@a_domingus) <a href="https://twitter.com/a_domingus/status/1000775194322001927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2018</a></blockquote>

<h4>Reading more</h4>
<p>
  As you might of noticed from the table at the start of this post I'm on track to read almost double the number of books from previous years.  I'm more settled in my career and have more head space to read. My commute has also changed - on average I gain about 1h of reading time over a week from previous years. It's felt a natural change and I'm sure the number will rise and fall as life changes over the next few years.
</p>

<h4>Metrics</h4>
<p>
  While I'll continue to list the books I read and take note of the genders I'm not going to add any more metrics.  Too many statistics and targets spoil the beauty of reading books. My day job is dealing with analytics and numbers and I want my free time to be a balance to that. I'm concious that there is a huge world out there and many genres of book that I may have no idea exist. I'll keep my eyes peeled and my mind open to new opportunities.  Any suggestions of books/authors that are away from the normal will be gratefully received. The one thing I generally don't do is read non fiction books - as long as there is a story then I'm happy.
