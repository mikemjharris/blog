  After two glorious years at the Royal Academy of Arts I changed jobs to work for Wonderbly. In the past I've outline preious career changes including from <a hre="/posts/changing-jobs">from Mammal to MOO</a>, <a href="/posts/new-job-new-infrastructure">internally at MOO</a> and finally <a href="/posts/working-at-the-ra">from MOO to the RA</a>.  These posts help me reflect and remember the thought process when going through these big life changes. This post is later than normal (I started the new job in Feb 2020) but life, including a pandemic, has kept me otherwise busy.

<h3>Two years at the RA</h3>
<p>
Looking back at <a href="/posts/working-at-the-ra">the reasons for moving to the RA</a> I got everything I wanted out of the job and so much more.  Professionally I progressed: my coding and understanding of technical architecture improved. Being a manager in charge of a small team was also a huge learning curve.  Personally being part of the RA and the museum sector was wonderful - there were so many interesting people to meet and fantastic shows to see. Everyone was incredibly welcoming and I learnt a huge amount art and the museum sector.
</p>
<p>
  The main project I was involved in while tech lead at the RA was the introduction of a new ticketing, membership and CRM system. We kicked off procurement in my first week there and spent the next two years working with teams across the whole of the organisation to update both the technology and the day to day processes. There was huge support for the project and I was incredibly lucky to join a brilliant team. There were some big challenges along the way but we had good fun and was really happy to have help deliver such a major change to how the RA is setup.
</p>
<p>
  There were many other projects including the final stages of showcasing the ongoing digitisation of our artworks online, the continuous improvment of the Summer Exhibition catalogue (where we roughly doubled online sales each year), partnering with Substrakt on the Young Artists summer exhibition, launching an internal tool to manage artworks lent to us as well as upkeep and maintenance of our blog and website.
</p>
<h3>More than just a job</h3>
<p>
  Working at the RA was so much more than delivering on all the projects we were working on.  Obviously they were the priority but in the two years I also got to embrace the art world - something that I never thought I'd get paid to do.
</p>
<p>
  Getting to mix and work with all the teams and peopls at the RA was a unique experience - from the front of house staff, through to marketing, the exhibitions team, the RA schools, archive, the library and the executive team. Such an amazing set of people who were all very generous with their time and knowlegde.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the highlights away from the work including moving into a newly refurbished building, celebrating as part of the RA's 250th anniversary, visting all the shows - often wondering round deserted galleries prior to starting work for the day, amazing christmas parties, celeb spotting at the summer exhibition preview parties and two amazing trips to the yearly Tessitrua conference in the US - mixing with arts organisations form across the world.
</p>
<h3>Why Move?</h3>
<p>
  That all sounds wonderful so why move? In my mind the role was always roughly a two year stint and I was always clear to my boss about this. I wanted to deliver the key project, make the most of all the opportunities on offer and then move back to a company with a bigger tech team.  I learnt a huge amount being in charge at the RA but wanted to be in a team with more senior people around to help me progress.  Other factors also came into play - from being able to earn more money outside the arts, finding an office closer to my east London home and also a new challenge.  I also wanted to leave before the arts became just another day in the office - while it still felt fresh and magical and I could leave with such amazing memories.
</p>
<h3>New Job</h3>
  <p>
    As we finished the major project at the RA I was approached by a recruiter on linkedin about a role at Wonderbly. I knew quite a bit about them having gone to a talk from Asi the founder back in 2013 as well as knowing a few of the people who worked there through others tech events around the same time. Everything slotted into place - a couple of interviews, an offer and I had a job closer to home, more money and also a product I cared about.  Wonderbly do personalised books and rely on the tech but also have an amazing team of story tellers, illustrators and designers as well as tech and marketing.  The books themselves were beautiful and something to get excited about. The setup and atmosphere felt a bit like MOO where I worked previously and had really enjoyed my time.
  </p>

  <p>
    ALl that was left was to say good bye to the RA - enjoying leaving drinks, a lovely leaving message from my boss and one final glorious RA christmas party.  I'd negotiated a month off (thank you Wonderbly!) so was off to Bali to complete <a href="/posts/all-yoga.htm">my yoga teacher training</a>.

  <h3>Starting a new job in 2020</h3>

      Three months is a long time but allowed me to help the RA recruit my replacement and also allowed me to attend that years incredible christmas party. January I spent in Bali completing my Yoga Teacher Training and at the start of February 2020.  I got a warm welcome including a team cooked breakfast of shakshuka. The tech team at the RA consisted of myself as the tech lead and three developers.  At wonderbly I was tech lead for my team of three responsible for the ecommerce side of the website with another tech lead in charge of another two dvelopers with responsibilites
