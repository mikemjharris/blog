<p>
  After two glorious years at the Royal Academy of Arts I changed jobs to work for Wonderbly. When changing jobs I like to write a few notes first as a reminder to myself and secondly for the interest of others who may be interested in the thought process of swapping roles.  In the past I've outline preious career changes including from <a hre="/posts/changing-jobs">from Mammal to MOO</a>, <a href="/posts/new-job-new-infrastructure">internally at MOO</a> and finally <a href="/posts/working-at-the-ra">from MOO to the RA</a>.  This post is abit later than normal (I started the new job in Feb 2020) but life, including a pandemic, has kept me otherwise busy.
</p>

<h3>A look back at two yeras at the RA</h3>
<p>
Looking back at <a href="/posts/working-at-the-ra">the reasons for moving to the RA</a> I got everything I wanted out of the job and so much more.  Professionally I progressed and learnt lots more about technical aspects as well as about managing a team.  Away from the code the RA itself and the whole museum world was magical - I got to meet so many interesting people and learnt a huge amount about art and that sector.
</p>
<p>
  The main project that spanned my time there (introducing a new ticketing, membership and CRM system) was a success.  I was incredibly lucky to have joined at a time when there was backing from the whole organisation to make that project work, as well as being part of an excellent team who were a pleasure to work with and we all complemented each others strengths. It was also a lot of fun too.
</p>
<p>
  There were many other projects including the final stages of showcasing the ongoing digitisation of our artworks online, the continuous improvment of the Summer Exhibition online catalogue (where we roughly doubled online sales each year), partnering with Substrakt on the Young Artists summer exhibition, launching an internal tool to manage artworks lent to us for shows and continuouse improvements to our main website and blog.
</p>
<p>
  My time there coincided witha big refurbishement and the 250th celebrations.  There were some incredible exhibitions and being able to wander round them before the public were allowed in, inviting friends anad family to look around, popping into other galleries for free and attending two Tessitura conferences in America whre I got to mix with people from cultural institutions from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
  I loved my time there and I was very fortunate to be there at a time with full support for our team and the major proejcts
</p>
<h3>Why Move?</h3>
<p>
  That all sounds wonderful so why move?  I was clear with my boss from my first interview and throughout my time there that I would be moving on at some point. Being the most senior tech person I learnt a lot from that experience but I knew at some stage I wanted to be back in a bigger tech team with more senior and experienced people that I could learn off. I think knowing that my time there was for a set time I made teh most of all the opportunities and got to leave before the magic wore off and it became routine.  It also felt like once the major project was delivered there would be a tightening of belts and fewer interesting projects.
</p>
  <p>
    Secondly logisitic - it was the first time I've regulalry commuted on public transport and while it wasn't too bad I wanted to work somewhere closer to my east London home.  Other reasons for moving incluing more money, a change and a new challenge.
  </p>
  <h3>New Job</h3>
  <p>
    Just as we were finishing our major project  a message from a recruiter for Wonderbly caught my attention. I knew about them as I'd attended a talk by the founder asi back in XXXX and had met the head of product Nick Marsh at events at Makeshift (his previous company).  Both of these were before I had changed careers into tech but was trying to learn more about the tech world. From those events and following them on twitter for a number of years meant I knew about wonderbly - they create beautiful personalised childrens books.  It felt similar to MOO (the job I was at prior to the RA which I enjoyed) with a bit of art thrown in.  The job spec seemed to match up as well - it was a tech lead role with a mix of code and managing using technologies such as rails, node and react - all of which I've worked with over the past few years.
  </p>
  <p>
    I chatted to friends and family about the role and am lucky that through my connections I could chat to people with direct exereince of working at the company.
  <p>
    The intereviews went well (I recall it was a very very hot day and got incredibly sweaty in the office) There was some general chatting and some whiteboarding.  John the recruiter was super helpful and helped things go along smoothly - providing me with lots of useful information and thoughts throughout the process. I had a three month notice but also wanted an extra month off - I know WOnderbly were keen for someone to start as soon as possible but was honoured they were prepared to wait four months for me to join.
  </p>
  <h3>How's it going so far</h3>
  <p>
      Three months is a long time but allowed me to help the RA recruit my replacement and also allowed me to attend that years incredible christmas party. January I spent in Bali completing my Yoga Teacher Training and at the start of February 2020.  I got a warm welcome including a team cooked breakfast of shakshuka. The tech team at the RA consisted of myself as the tech lead and three developers.  At wonderbly I was tech lead for my team of three responsible for the ecommerce side of the website with another tech lead in charge of another two dvelopers with responsibilites
