  After two glorious years at the Royal Academy of Arts I changed jobs to work for Wonderbly. In the past I've outline preious career changes including from <a hre="/posts/changing-jobs">from Mammal to MOO</a>, <a href="/posts/new-job-new-infrastructure">internally at MOO</a> and finally <a href="/posts/working-at-the-ra">from MOO to the RA</a>.  These posts help me reflect and remember the thought process when going through these big life changes. This post is later than normal (I started the new job in Feb 2020) but life, including a pandemic, has kept me otherwise busy.

<h3>Two years at the RA</h3>
<p>
Looking back at <a href="/posts/working-at-the-ra">the reasons for moving to the RA</a> I got everything I wanted out of the job and so much more.  Professionally I progressed: my coding and understanding of technical architecture improved. Being a manager in charge of a small team was also a huge learning curve.  Personally being part of the RA and the museum sector was wonderful - there were so many interesting people to meet and fantastic shows to see. Everyone was incredibly welcoming and I learnt a huge amount art and the museum sector.
</p>
<p>
  The main project I was involved in while tech lead at the RA was the introduction of a new ticketing, membership and CRM system. We kicked off procurement in my first week there and spent the next two years working with teams across the whole of the organisation to update both the technology and the day to day processes. There was huge support for the project and I was incredibly lucky to join a brilliant team. There were some big challenges along the way but we had good fun and was really happy to have help deliver such a major change to how the RA is setup.
</p>
<p>
  There were many other projects including the final stages of showcasing the ongoing digitisation of our artworks online, the continuous improvment of the Summer Exhibition catalogue (where we roughly doubled online sales each year), partnering with Substrakt on the Young Artists summer exhibition, launching an internal tool to manage artworks lent to us as well as upkeep and maintenance of our blog and website.
</p>
<h3>More than just a job</h3>

<p>
  Working at the RA was so much more than delivering on all the projects we were working on.  Obviously they were the priority but in the two years I also got to embrace the art world - something that I never thought I'd get paid to do.
</p>
<p>
  Getting to mix and work with all the teams and peopls at the RA was a unique experience - from the front of house staff, through to marketing, the exhibitions team, the RA schools, archive, the library and the executive team. Such an amazing set of people who were all very generous with their time and knowlegde.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some of the highlights away from the work including moving into a newly refurbished building, celebrating as part of the RA's 250th anniversary, visting all the shows - often wondering round deserted galleries prior to starting work for the day, amazing christmas parties, celeb spotting at the summer exhibition preview parties and two amazing trips to the yearly Tessitrua conference in the US - mixing with arts organisations form across the world.
</p>
<h3>Why Move?</h3>
<p>
  That all sounds wonderful so why move? In my mind the role was always roughly a two year stint and I was always clear to my boss about this. I wanted to deliver the key project, make the most of all the opportunities on offer and then move back to a company with a bigger tech team.  I learnt a huge amount being in charge at the RA but wanted to be in a team with more senior people around to help me progress.  Other factors also came into play - from being able to earn more money outside the arts, finding an office closer to my east London home and also a new challenge.  I also wanted to leave before the arts became just another day in the office - while it still felt fresh and magical and I could leave with such amazing memories.
</p>
<h3>New Job</h3>
  <p>
    As we finished the major project at the RA I was approached by a recruiter on linkedin about a role at Wonderbly. I knew quite a bit about them having gone to a talk from Asi the founder back in 2013 as well as knowing a few of the people who worked there through others tech events around the same time. Everything slotted into place - a couple of interviews, an offer and I had a job closer to home, more money and also a product I cared about.  Wonderbly do personalised books and rely on the tech but also have an amazing team of story tellers, illustrators and designers as well as tech and marketing.  The books themselves were beautiful and something to get excited about. The setup and atmosphere felt a bit like MOO where I worked previously and had really enjoyed my time.
  </p>

  <p>
    ALl that was left was to say good bye to the RA - enjoying leaving drinks, a lovely leaving message from my boss and one final glorious RA christmas party.  I'd negotiated a month off (thank you Wonderbly!) so was off to Bali to complete <a href="/posts/all-yoga.htm">my yoga teacher training</a>.

  <h3>Starting a new job in 2020</h3>

    There's was a great welcome from the team when I joined - all the simple but essential things that you need on day one - computer ready to go, welcome pack explaining how life at wonderbly works, where toilets are, where the meeting rooms are, what to expect during a week.  Everyone was incredibly helpful, friendly and supportive.  One of the attractions of working at a place with wonderbly is that it's not just tech people - there's the artists, storytellers, product team both physical and digital and many more - I got to meet everyone pretty quickly and got an intro in the weekly friday meeting. Changing job is a huge upheaval and every time I've done it there's a few panicy moments in the first few weeks/months as you learn how a new company works, get to grips with the systema and also try and set your own processes and ways of doing things. Having a good onboarding process and being made to feel welcome helps with this upheaval hugely and allowed me focus on the task of understanding the systems
  </p>
  <p>
    The tech team at Wonderbly is split into two teams - those who look after the development of the books and my team who deal with the ecommerce website and fullfilement.  The RA website generated roughly the same revenue as the Wonderbly website but at Wonderlby this is pretty much the only source of revenue so there is a lot of pressure to make sure everything is working! Our team looks after the user facing website (built with Node and React) and our backend e-commerce system (Ruby on Rails) and we help out with a nmber of systems including how books are sent to and fulfilled by the printers and also emails.  My time is split between managing the two developers and one QA on my team (all of whom mainly focus on the website codebase) and being the main developer on the backend systmes (with help from the VP of engineering).  I enjoy the split between hands on coding and managing - my priority is always to make sure the team is supported and 1-1s are the most important part of the week. It's a lot of responsiblity being in charge of the systems and a team but exactely the sort of challenge I was looking for and having the support from the CTO and VP of engineering is just the setup I was keen to have.
  </p>

    Obviously 2020 isn't a normal year. Covid news was beginning to seep into the UK conciousness.  Most of February it still felt quite different and I focussed on getting into a new rhythem with work.  I find setting a good impression and building up trust and a solid reputation for delivery as soon as possible makes life much easier in the longer term.  First impressions matter.  February was spent working hard, joining in with company activies (run club, dinner out with the yearly meeting with our printers, enjoying a breakfast cooked for me with the team and making the effort to go out for coffess or lunch with as many people as possible). One of the reasons for joining Wonderbly was it's location and was enjoying regular swims in the Lido and being able to walk to work.  All this was disrupted as the covid cloud gathered and finally by the end of March we were in lockdown.
  </p>
  <p>
    We were very fortunate as a company in the covid didn't have much of an impact on sales or revenue.  The enforced remote work took some time to make work properly but there was lots of support and guidance from across the organistaion.  Everyone helped out setup new processes not only to make the remote work happen better but also to support peoples physicla and mental well being.  For me and my team we made sure there was extra time to talk about how people were feeling and coping. As a company we made sure being remote meant more flexibitliy - there was encouragement to work the hours that suited as long as meetings could be fitted in.  As a managed I made sure I wasn't working excessively - would make set examples by taking longer lunch breaks, sharing that I was taking more time to go for a walk, shop, have a nap. With individuals we updated targets, shifted or removed goals for the year - the main aim was to keep things ticking along and survive the pandemic - but work is important to people's mental health and having readjusted goals still meant there was a sense of purpose and happiness when those were achieved.
</p>
<p>
  It hasn't all been perfect - we had some hiccups in end of August when we tried to do too many things. It enforced the message that you need to be even clearer with messaging when remote - we learnt from that, sorted out the crunch, delayed a project and worked out how to prevent that happening again.  Overall though people have enojyed the remote work and felt productive although there is also a desire to be back in the office. During the summer easing the office was open for small groups and being able to do a couple of days there and have face to face 1-1s and other meetings made a huge difference.  Who knows how ways of working will change - I know I can manage remote working now but think some hybrid of a few days in the office is the sweet spot.  Am aware this is still early days and is still what is enforced on us so let's see how I feel later</p?

<h3>Summar</h3>

<p> This post was mainly meant to be about why I changed jobs so don't want to dive too much more into how things are now (10 months in now!).  While it was the right decision to leave the RA I was still sad to go.  Wodnerlby from the start was super friendly and welcoming - while new it felt familiar and friendly.  As always with a new job there were stressful or panicy moments in the first few months as you are still settling in (and this year a pandemic is happening).  But am really happy with where we are - there's been good feedback on the work we've done and the pace of delivery.  We've hit targets and helped the company do well so far.  The team seems to be doing well and am enjoying suppoting and helping develop my teammebers.  A proud point this year was when I won the kind aware at the end of T presentation - this is voted across the whole company and was honoured that on top of doing good work people enjoy having me as part of the company.  I'm settled in now, it's a startup and we have a small team with a lot of responsiblity so there is alway some stress and living on the edge but I have a great team around and above me and just the right sort of challenge I was looking for.
