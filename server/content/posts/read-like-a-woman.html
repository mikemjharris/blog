  I feel that I am a modern man and hopefully my attitudes and views on all parts of society are fair and reasonable.We are creatures of the world around us and I'm concious that I have grown up in male doiminated industries and as such am aware that some of the ways I interact with the world may not be as fair as I would like to think they are.  Self awareness is always tough but I aim to analyse my behaviour and correct and improve when I feel I have been lacking.  One thing I always thought was in my favour was that I loved reading


  <p>
  That was until I read this guardian article: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/18/you-might-not-think-youre-a-sexist-until-you-take-a-look-at-your-bookshelf">'You might not think you're a sexist until you take a look at your bookshelf'</a>. The TLDR; version is that we generally read more books by male authors.  One quote from it which I think is very apt: "when your worldview is solely shaped by men, you are missing out".

    What rubbish I thought - I read lots of books on a wide range of topics and I'm sure I have an even balance between male and female authors (and authors of different races and religions to take it to the next step).  I'm not an accidental sexist! And to prove it I keep a record of the books I read. So let me prove to you what a modern man I am

  Hmmm - not so enlightened.  The books I read covered a whole range of topics and genres - all fiction (bar the odd autobiography). I felt I was learning lots about the world but the view was predominantly male driven.  I now understood how people felt coped in major disasters and wars, I could understand the daily struggles of people in Vietnam or change in the working environment for middle class America. There was sympathy for the daily struggle of alcoholics and the racism in the South west.  But there was very little in how women coped and dealt with the world.  While I feel I am intelligent enough to understand many of the big issues and struggles woman have to deal with in many parts of western culture I didn't understand the small subtle points of what it is like to be a woman at any point in history. I was an accidental sexist.

    So I took a conscious effort in 2015 I read more female authors. There are many, they aren't hard to find. I don't know why I read more male authors - maybe historically more men wrote?  Maybe the top classics are male dominated? I read the article in May 2015 and the remainder of the books of that year were all by women. And I learnt lots. There were some awesome books - a bit too much suicide (I think four books in a row) but a very enjoyable few months. 2015 my split was 5 books by male authors, 6 by women.

    Great I was cured of my accidental sexism! But life isn't that easy.  I thought I had corrected my bad habit and now I would be a balanced and enlightened reader. But you need to be constantly on top of a bad habit to stop from slipping into bad ways.  2016 my first book was by a female author but I am sorry to say the next six have been male.  I had excuses but not that could explain that.

    <p> So this is an article to myself to be more aware, to try and be more conscious of what I read and to try and have a more balanced literary diet. Hopefully this might inspire you to take a look at what you read - is it all about tech?  is it all by white middle aged men?  or by any other classification be that race, location, genre, date etc. Maybe a better balance would help your view on the world in many situations
    </p>

    <p> Postscript:  I have very carefully left out the types books and authors that I have read.  That isn't important - if you like literary classics, or trashy modern novels try and get a balance of the voice speaking.  And ideally maybe mix up some trash with classics and vice versa.  You might enjoy or learn something new. </p>
