  In this post I want to highlight a new Guardian article that has provided me with new reading material. In previous posts I've written about how a similar article had altered the books I read (<a href="/posts/accidental-sexist">Accidental Sexist</a> and <a href="/posts/book-balance">Book Balance</a>). This follows on the theme of trying to read authors from more diverse backgrounds.
</p>

<h4>Still relevant</h4>
<p>
With the #MeToo movement this look at imbalance in the world of literature is as relevant as ever.  Checkout this excellent Guardian article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/02/how-to-be-good-man-me-too-month-reading-feminist-classics">How to be a Good Man</a>. This sentence, I feel, sums up what the author was looking to do:
</p>

<p class="quote">I wanted to to sit down and read about womenâ€™s experiences, to stay silent for a while, and hopefully learn something.
</p>

<p>
  The irony that the article is written by a man isn't lost on me however it has provided a list of 13 books - only one of which I've read.
</p>

<h4>Book project</h4>
<p>
  I'm building an webapp to list out the books I've read which I wrote about that in this post <a href="book-project-pt1">Book Project - Part 1</a>. You can see the project at <a href="https://books.mikemjharris.com">books.mikemjharris.com</a>
<p>

<h4>Tips</h4>
<p>
Would love your tips on non white authors to read.  Am aware that I've written mostly about reading more female authors but I am trying to cast my net wider.  Recent issues such as having <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/16/all-white-carnegie-medal-longlist-anger-childrens-authors-philip-pullman">all white nominees</a> for the Carnegie medal longlist have encouraged me to research and read more BAME authors too. Recommendations please!
