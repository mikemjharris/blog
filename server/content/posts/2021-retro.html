<p>
  Well crikey - what a year! In <a href="/posts/2020-retro">last year's retro</a> I reckoned we'd have more of the same pandemic life but I think we all hoped for the vaccine saviour narrative. As that seemed to unfold and life opened up the breath we'd all been holding for 2020 started to be released - sometimes in smooth releases, sometimes in violent, hard sobs. Lots of the stress and tension seemed to come out this year - lots of life opening up but, certainly in my friend circle, it seemed like we had to deal with a year and a half of life in a short time. Fun and maybe too exciting. Life but trauma playing out.  On top of it all a weariness and lack of energy. But how does all that chaos reflect in the numbers?

<h4>Stats - running for the year</h4>
<p>
  Stats wise? Numbers wise kinda like 2017/16 but with a few more books read. And what's that last one?  Cycling?  Never tracked that properly - what's that all about? The number that most reflects my year is the KM run.  We started off with monotonous lock down - the running was steady. I around half the total for the year in the first three months. But I struggled with a lack of yoga.  I went on an <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4990521902" target="_blank">excessively long run</a> to prove I'm still young on my 40th birthday. Obviously that half injured me but I'd signed up for an ultra. It was the first thing open post lockdown and stuborness meant I ran round most of it with a friend and <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/51424576222">limped the final 10k.</a> And that probably is the best metaphor for the year - desperate to get out and do everything - but overdoing it. Loving it all, but taking on too much and being underprepared.  Still I made it to the end of the run and I made it to the end of the year - with what might be a a grimace, or even perhaps a smile.

<h4>Cycling</h4>
<p>
  So cycling was probably the big revelation this year.  Early in the year I wrote about <a href="/posts/pedalling-through-a-pandemic">pedalling through a pandemic</a> about the online Zwift league I'd raced in over the winter. As hoped this translated to real world cycling - lots of rides with the neighbour opposite, other friends and colleagues. A highlight was 100km <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/5344132556">tour of the peak district</a> - again early days of life opening up and this went much better than my running ultra! Amazing views and a novelty to have a trip away with friends - salve for the body and soul.
</p>
<p>
  On top of normal cycling I also had a go at bike packing - a number of [twitter friends|acquaintances|randoms who I follow] seem to have done something similar. As with many people I had a craving to do something different and also get out into nature.  Strapping a bunch of bags to you and pedalling off into the distance was certainly an excellent way to spend time. Slowly got into it and hoping that the investigative work this year will mean some longer trips in the futures.

<h4>New years resolutions</h4>
<p>
  Given the uncertainty last year the only resolution I half mentioned was doing more creative writing.  I did a bit - doing a few of the excellent <a href="https://write-and-shine.com/">write and shine</a> sessions. Much of the year was laying down the foundations - following the right people, buying the books - eyeing up a new hobby working out how to fit it into life. More of this to come over the next few years I hope.
</p>
<p>
  Last year setting big goals was foolish - but in the back of my mind I was turning 40. As a middle class, middle aged man one of the recognised ways to celebrate a big milestone is to do an excessive sporting event. Certainly that's how I <a href="https://30thmarathonmadness.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">celebrated my 30th (content warning - me in a dress)</a>. At the end of last year I signed up for my first half Ironman and hoped that would go ahead and I'd be in shape. Covid played ball and despite my running injuries I made it round. Tick that midlife crisis box.

<h4>Swimming and yoga</h4>
<p>
  Not much to say here - swimming - some cold water/open water at the start of the year - but as pools opened stuck with them.  Holidays happened and a much needed trip abroad with the excellent <a href="https://www.swimtrek.com/">swim trek</a> folks. Yoga too got a boost - studios opened and being in the warm snug embrace of the hot pod yoga studio was a massive boost.
</p>
<h4>Books and art and stuff</h4>
<p>
  Fewer books - but hey I was out there injuring myself on life! 19 female authors vs 12 male and no non binary this year - 35% ethnically contrasting voices. Best books? Olivia Laing's - Funny Weather - Art in an Emergency, Ted Chiang's Exhalation,  Anuk Arudpragasam's A Passage North. Other notable mentions - had lots of fun with The Salt Path and Francis Bacon's biography was an ample replacement for missing his postponed exhibition.
</p>
<<p>
  Art?  Paula Rego's exhibition at the Tate a clear winner. David Hockney's Arrival of Spring though was a perfect tonic for the year - simple easy but joyful. Loads more and some plays, shows, life, culture. Was it good?  Or just good to be out?
</p>

<h4>Life</h4>
<p>
  So much more happening in the world - lots of people going through a tough time especially later on in the year.  Felt like two years of the usual bumps in the road compressed into the autumn season. With it everyone weary, tired and not being able to be as supportive as usual. Many phone calls (when they finally happened!) started with both sides apologising for absence, lack of messages, general tiredness.
</p>
<p>
  Those bumps in life meant I briefly ended up living with a friend who I last lived with 20 years ago.  Back then I nursed him through cancer treatment. Sharing space again we marvelled that we had pretty much blocked that period of our life out. The joys and ignorance of youth. Lots to catch up and reminisce and work through. Then history semi repeated itself - he caught Covid and I was back to being nurse. Enjoyed that shared time but it did mean my energy to be a good friend to others was diminished. There's not always a silver lining in life - but sometimes there is. Take the ups with the downs.
</p>
<h4>Mentoring</h4>
<p>
  One of the best things I did last year was mentoring. Late in 2020 I was approached roughly at the same time by four different friends/connections and as a result started 2021 with four mentees. The pandemic meant there was plenty of time and we'd all got used to hoping on a call. As life opened up two of the mentees dropped off - although believe they found the sessions useful. The other two continue to be part of my monthly routine. I've learnt a huge amount in the process - I love chatting to people, learning how they see the world and how they are navigating their careers. I believe (and have been told!) that my mentoring has been beneficial to them.  I've listened, offered a space to discuss issues and given my thoughts and stories when needed. It's very different from being a manager (although with many overlapping skills) - being distant but close is a unique position and am really happy that I have helped my mentees out and also grown and learnt myself.
</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
  Well another year!  Ups and downs, highs and lows - running fast then dealing with injury and over excitement. Who knows what the new year brings.  For me the usual mix of hobbies with even more creative writing. Hopefully some more bikepacking, perhaps some travel. This year though a bit steadier, a bit slower, a bit more thoughtful. Let's see how it all goes.
