<p>
  Some of my recent posts have looked at how I've been running my home dev environment in the cloud and how I've switched to using a chromebook coupled up with a remote VM. For both of these I was using Amazon's cloud service (AWS). I wanted to see how it would be to try and do the same using Microsofts Azure cloud platform.
</p>

<h4>Why AWS in the first place...?</h4>
<p>
 I used AWS for both familiarity and it's prevalence.  It's the platform used at the last two places I've worked and is one of the most poplular systems for running code in the cloud. For a new project you can focus on the 'new' bits without worrying about a new system.  In addition AWS skills are in demand - part of the point of having side projects is to learn and develop my skills.
</p>

<h4>Why switch to Azure?</h4>
<p>
  Lots of reasons! Firstly curiosity - I've been working in the Amazon eco system for a while and was interested in how a different might approach the interface, naming and running of all the different systems.Secondly Azure is getting increasingly popular.  Microsoft seem to be doing a great job of expanding their footprint in the developer space and am hearing of more and more organistations using or thinking of switching to Azure. How would I find a new platform? 
  </p>

  <h4>My challenge</h4>
  <p> 
  In previous posts I've detailed how I've got a whole bunch of config and scripts that I run on a fresh linux install to setup how I want my dev environment.  For now (even in aws) the initial setup of the box is done manually via the AWS GUI.  I wanted to see how quickly I could get up to speed with the Microsoft interface. This would also be a test for my config - there shouldn't be any differnence between an ubuntu box in AWS vs Azure but I wanted to make sure everything ran smoothly.

 </p>
 <h3>Result</h4>
 <p> 
  Success!  Everything went pretty smoothly.  From signing up to a MS account I was up and running with everything setup within 30mins.  The vast majority is similar to AWS even if the words are different and the buttons and layout drasticaly different. I followed this tutorial https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal combined with the usual dollop of googling on the side and a bi of trial and error and clicking on things I thought would work. 
 </p>

 <h4>Conclusion</h4>

   <p>
   Probably unsuprisingly Azure isn't that much different from AWS! I've been using the AWS interface online for a while and have a bit of stockholm syndrome.  Using Azure was differnet and a step outside the comfort zone. But it feels like lots of work has gone into a smooth user experience and once I'd got my head round the new terminology found it a much better GUI. TBH I should really be doing all of this using terraform ... guess that's the next side project to add to the list.
