   Techy tech tip - this one for those of your who need to use the terminal.  The key combo - `Ctrl-r` (of Cmd-r` for mac users) is super handy in helping you find and reuse commands you've used previously - whether that's a regular, often used one or helping you recall some distant memory of a one of sequence.

<h4>Quick way to get an old commands</h4>
<p>
  Using the terminal can be super powerful but also tricky.  There's no clearly labelled button to click - just an empty line and a cursor.  It's up to you to remember or find out what to type.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately a lot of the commands are the same and repeated.  In case you don't have a letter perfect memory or are bored of typing then `Ctrl-r`  helps out.  It shows you all the previous commands you've used and filters them as you type - all you have to do is remember a few letters.
<p>

<h4>Why not alias</h4>
<p>
Aliases are super helpful - you assign a few letters to a command. I find that I use `Ctrl-r` instead of aliases. You don't have to remember a specific couple of letters, you can quickly find similar commands (say git pull, git pull --rebase, git stash && git pull) without having to save and remember different shortcuts.  Finally you still see and interact with the actual command rather than a custom to you shortcut - also helpful when pairing where your partner wont have the same aliases as you.
</p>
<p>
As with most things a personal preference - aliases do a great job. Sometime thought it's that half remembered command you ran ages ago that you need though and that's where `Ctrl-r` comes into it's own. A combo of the two will likely be the sweet spot.
</p>
<h4>Super charge with fzf</h4>
<p>
The native `Ctrl-r` works OK but it gets a turbo charge when used with <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" target="_blank">fzf - command line fuzzy finder</a>.  Instead of the standard 'one result' you can see a longer history and can navigate with vim bindings.
</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>
 Most developers need to use the terminal and in most cases wont have a memory that will store enough shortcuts or commands.  Using `Ctrl-r` makes it much easier to reuse commands - whether a standard git command or that super complex sed/grep chain you spent ages creating. It's all there a few key strokes away.

  Now alll of these emails are all valid emails and will end up in the same inbox.

<h3>Three reasons why this is useful</h3>

<h4>Filter out spam</h4>
<p>
  You want that 10% discount but aren't that interested in the newsletter. You need a one off email to sign in to that fun game service. You know you'll get some spam. By using the first example email you can have a filter set on your inbox so that those emails to that address never hit your main inbox. If your email gets sold any new emails will also be filtered out keeping your focus on the important emails.
</p>


<h4>Specific emails for companies</h4>

<p>
You may want to have specific emails for certain companies.  This could help with security (not using the same email everywhere) or help you group emails together.  The example here uses 'bt' but you could use something like 'bills' or 'household'.
</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
 At work I need to do regular testing - this also involves getting emails.  By using the plus sign I can create multiple users and still get the email flows.  There also isn't the risk of using a domain not in my control and ending up with test or live emails going to the wrong person.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
  Three examples of how the plus sign in the email can be useful and I am sure you can imagine plenty more. It enables labelling of the emails when you sign up to something helping preemptively keeping your inbox clean. 
</p>
<p>
Overall the final testing example is the one I use all the time but the plus sign comes in useful many times.
