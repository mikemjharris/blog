This is a list of the technologies and tools I used when building this blog. The next few posts I’ll look into these in more details, about the choices I made and the issues I had along the way.

<h4>Front End</h4>
<ul>
  <li>JQuery</li>
  <li>Handlebars</li>
  <li>Gulp (plus a whole load of gulp tools to make life easy)</li>
  <li>Sass</li>
</ul>

<h4>Back End</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Node</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>Handlebars (again!  more about that in a future blog post)</li>
  <li>Mongodb (sort of - was part of the biggest decision about building this blog)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Deployment / Other</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Git & Github</li>
  <li>Docker</li>
  <li>Python Simple Server</li>
  <li>Bash (does scripting count?  Built a really smooth continuous integration system)</li>
  <li>Nginx</li>
</ul>
