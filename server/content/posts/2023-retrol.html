  2023 was steady.  Got stuck into work in my second year at FLOWN.  Took on a road marathon for the first time in six years and generally looked aftermyself after a bad back in 2022.

<h4>Story in the Stats</h4>
<p>
Yoga and running took center stage this year.  After last years bad back one of <a href="/posts/2022-retro.html">my 2022 resolutions</a> was to continue to physically look after myself.  During the day that meant more movement and not getting stuck at the desk. When time allowed yoga kept everything nicely oiled and strong.  Most years see dips in attendance but this year the memory of sore backs and some tightness and aches in my right leg if I didn't attened helped keep my practice regular. I also switched to a new studio, BLOK, which helped keep things fresh.
</p>
<p> 
Running was back to normal.  When I started the year in good health I decided to take on another road marathong.  I hadn't done one since 2017 - having shifter to trail and ultra running. Initally I'd signed up to a spring marathon but life got in the way so shifter to tackling Valencia in December.  Part of the challenge was to see if now I was 40, and post a pandemic and tight back could get close to previous times.  I set myself the target of going sub 3 and with a relatively smooth training regime and the help of new super shoes achieved that goal. Doing track sessions with Run Dusty and Track East massively helped my training.
</p>

<p> 
Elsewhere swimming and cycling took a back seat with the focus on that running goal and keeping flexible. On the swim front completed the same 5k event in Formentera as last year - although was a different course due to changing weather conditions.  In the past I've usually fitted in swimming with going to an office - this year has been mainly remote and has been harder to fit in as a result.
</p>
<h4>Books and art and stuff</h4>
<p>Much fewer books read this year although the number slighlty skewed by the size of some of the novels that I tackled. The book/travel combo this year was Marseille and the epic Count of Monte Cristo.  A fabulous fast book although lost some of it's edge near the end. Also travelled to Paris and read Banine's Parisian Days - which was pretty good although not as good as her previous novel 'A Day in the Caucus' which was up there for my favourite of the year. Laura Cumming's Thunderclap (she also featured in last year's faves) and Deborah Levy's Swimming Home round out the top books of the year.</p>
<p>
On the art front got to visit <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqbKTXbI6ge/">Cezanne's studio</a> and hike around <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CqhqE2fIlaF/">Saint Victoire</a> - nicely syncing with the Cezanne exhibition at the Tate.  On the same tripe was in Arles so got to see the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cqds3l_ISav/">Can Gogh museum.</a> and also an immersive exhibition of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp7CzwIoUhs/">Paul Klee</a> and Marc Chagall in Paris.
</p>
<p>Another immersive was my highlight for the year - the David Hockney at the lightbox.  As well as the full wall experience of his art there was also soem history, photos and throughout his voice narating. His art is fantastic in a big space but this direct input by the artist into the exhicition added that extra bit of delight that was missign from the Paris shows. I saw the Hockney twice - once on a busy saturday with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CrWa0E6o7i7/">kids everywhere</a> and a second visit on a very <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cu6S9dLopwB/">quiet evening</a>. Completely different experiences and the show held it's own in both situations.  Fantastic to be part of a lively crowd enjoying the art as a shared experience but also a delight for a more meditative evening contempltaing a life of art</p>

<h4>Resolutions - past</h4>
<p>
One key resolution was to travel by train for trips less than 1000km. I managed this until the end of the year when I flew out to Basel.  Ealier in the year had managed a trip skiing and to the south of france via train.  The train trip took longer but was a different way of traveling and, combined with remote work allowed me a few days in Paris with friends, an amazing day in Geneva with friends, into the mountains to ski, then back down to Marseilles for ten days then back home again.  Cost was approcimately the same as flying and was much more enjoyable.
</p>
<p> 
The trip to Basel had originally been planned as a train trip but in the busy end of the year time got tight so flyling came into it's own.  A few days with a very close friend and my god children felt worth the flight especially as had done well the rest of the year.
</p>
<h4>Resolutions - future</h4>k

<p>
Keep up the yoga.  Won't tackle a marathon this year but want to keep the running ticking along. Will try and stick to the flying rule this year. The main new(ish) resolution is to get better at calisthenics which I tired properly for the first time this year.  In addiiton to devote more time to my free standing handstand - this was a <a hef="/posts/2018-new-years-resolutions.html">resolution in 2018</a> and is generally in the back of my mind.  I've slowly improved with snatches of pracitce in the gym or post swimming but want to devote more time to it this year.
</p>
<p>
Outside the main areas I talk about in these retros potentially have some big life changes this year so will see how that impacts things.  Though all of that keeping an open mind and keeping end of year targets for all of the usual stats fluid, while also relying on them as a some familarity and structure.
</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Steady year - some personal bumps along the way but the good habits, running, yoga, reading, helped keep me on top of any uncertaintity.  Really happy with the marathon run in Valencia and the train trip across Eurpe in the Spring was a delight.  Work has gone well - all be it with the usual ups and downs of an early stage startup.  More of the same next year with an open mind to tackle disruptions and uncertaintity.</p>
