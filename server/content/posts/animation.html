<!-- meta-data intro: A look into some of the animations used in this blog  -->

<p>
  I love building stuff on <a href="http://codepen.io/mikemjharris" target="_blank">codepen</a> there is an easy to use editor set-up up with all your favourite html and CSS preprocessors.  Your work is there whenever you need it and is easily shareable. Most important has been the community - lots of encouragement as well as tips from a great bunch of developers and designers.
</p>

<p>
  I've found that codepen is a great place to experiment and I'd built lots of fun interactions and proofs of concept but I often wondered how they would fit into the real world (and by real world I mean a full website which is probably stretching the term a little)
</p>

<p>
  One of the many reasons for this blog was to use some of my experiments and also to inspire me to build some new animations and interactions.  Some of the animation is really over the top and in your face (think the side menu bar if you are on desktop) whereas others are more subtle (such as the slight priming of the menu items as you hover over them followed by the recoil after they have fired). This post is just a broad review of the techniques and technologies involved as well as example pens. Their may be more detailed instructional posts in the future.
</p>

<h4>Technologies</h4>
<p>
  On this website I've shied away from using libraries to build the animation and relied instead upon standard CSS transition and animations as well as SVG and SMIL. I've found that libraries make things easier and better supported across browsers however I often don't learn as much about how the actual animations happen. This project is mainly for myself and generally the tech community who will generally be using a modern browser. As such I've preferred to learn more and sacrifice some performance / looks on older browsers.
</p>

<h4>Techniques</h4>
<p>
  Almost any post that I have read on animation usually refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation" target="_blank">Disney twelve basic principles of animation</a>. If you are into animation you will be sick of reading about it. If you aren't then it is worth a look over - one of those lists that you wouldn't come up with yourself but when you read it seems so obvious.
</p>

<h4>CSS animations</h4>
<p>
  For the menu and post showing the animations are all done with CSS animations and transitions and are triggered by adding and removing classes with Javascript.  While I am more than happy to use javascript for animation (I wrote a JS base <a href="http://snowman.mikemjharris.com" target="_blank">snowman shooting game</a>) I find that if you are just changing CSS attributes then that should be done with CSS.  JS for action, CSS for display.
</p>
<p>
  The springy menu on the left (on desktop) is a big, bouncy animation to show that the site is lively and fun.  I've stripped out the main animation and put it into a codepen.  While I could point you in the direction of the relevant code on github this would mean looking at several different files.  If you wanted to play with it you would have to set up the environment.  With codepen you can see the relevant parts all in one place and can tweak and fiddle to your hearts content.

<p>
  A quick reivew of the other animations involved with the menu system include a prime as you hover over, an explosion to the right as the menu item is catapulted left.  There is a little wibbly wobbly recoil. The right hand pane explodes with the new menu item.
</p>

<h4>SVG Animations</h4>
<p>
  This year I have lots of fun with SVG animations - I find them incredibly interesting and fun! My most popular codepen is the twitter animated follow button (shown below). I kindly borrowed the twitter logo and then animated it along a path with some 'followers' in tow. The word 'follow' is clipped from view and slowly shown.  This was done a while ago and I now wince at some of the long winded hacks I employed and the repetition of code. Makes me feel happy that I'm constantly learning and improving! In future a smattering of 'use' and a couple of frozen fill modes would provide a much neater solution.

<p>
  The twitter share button was done around the same time and has similar bits of painful code.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
  That was a brief overview of the animation techniques used in this blog - mainly CSS and SVG. Lots of fun making it and I think it adds energy to the whole project. Animation can be a a super powerful tool to improve the users understanding and interaction with a web page.  It can also be a huge distraction if used too much or in the wrong places.  My plan over the next months is to improve not only my knowledge of how to do good web animations (and the use of new technologies such as the web animation api) but to learn more about how they can complement and be integrated in to sites.
