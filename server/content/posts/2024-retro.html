<p>
What a terrible year according to the numbers.  Ok roughly the same number of books read and blog posts written but ooh - look at the exercise.  I've run more KM than that in one week before - and looks like I've hardly looked at the pool. Yoga - an essential the recent few years dropped significantly. 
</p>

<p>
  Nope - not a terrible injury or illness.  Had a baby - swapped out jogging for walking the baby in the pushchair, yoga for squating on the floor playing with toys.  Wouldn't change it for the world - wonderful, tiring, rewarding, frustrating, enlightening and so much more all in one.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Not much more to write really not least because I'm just started parental leave and the baby is likely to wake any moment. A year like no other - some mourning for the old life but the joy of the new outweighs that.  As an older parent some guilt of switching groups but delight at meeting new friends and knowing that there is a time and pattern to most things in life</p>
<p>For the next year let's see.  Am doing a lot of non trackable movement and exercise - lugging a 10kg baby around town, playing on the ground, thousands of stpes pushing a pram. The main aim for this year is to try out the running buggy. I also have a new job with a couple of days near victoria so will likely add back in a running commute. So hopefully more running this year but mainly prioritising family and a new job</p>
