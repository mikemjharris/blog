<p>
What a terrible year according to the numbers.  OK roughly the same number of books read and blog posts written but ooh - look at the exercise.  I've run more KM than that in two weeks before - and looks like I've hardly looked at the pool. Yoga - an essential the recent few years dropped significantly.

  Nope - not a terrible injury or illness.  Had a baby - swapped out jogging for trips out withe pushchair, yoga for squatting on the floor playing with toys.  Wouldn't change it for the world - wonderful, tiring, rewarding, frustrating, enlightening and so much more all in one.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Not much more to write really not least because I'm just started parental leave and the baby is likely to wake any moment. A year like no other - some mourning for the old life but the joy of the new outweighs that.  As an older parent some guilt of switching groups but delight at meeting new friends - knowing that life melds, flows and adapts.</p>
<p>For the next year let's see.  Am doing a lot of non trackable movement and exercise with caring for a baby . The main aim for this year is to try out the running buggy. I also have a new job with a couple of days near Victoria so will likely add back in a running commute - plus make sure that new role goes well. Would love to get back in the pool - hopefully some sessions for me but also to introduce the next generation to the joys of water.</p>
