  At work (<a href="https://flown.com">FLOWN.com</a>) we have live deep work sessions as well as plenty of on demand content.  Much of async content is professionally filmed but the whole team have also recently conrtibuted 25min videos.  Here's my video, some thoughts on why these are useful and some behind the scenes secrets!

<h4>Why do this?</h4>
<p>
  Why film myself?  Why provide this for others?  We touch on this in the <a href="https://flown.com/science-behind-flown">science behind FLOWN</a> blog post and others have written about effects such as how <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-doubling-productivity-adhd-wfhhttps://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-doubling-productivity-adhd-wfh">body doubling can boost productivity.</a>.

  In short - seeing others work helps put you in the mood.  If you're working and thing you're being observed then the chances are you work more.

<h4>Setting the scene</h4>
<p>
  Obviously filming yourself and putting your surroundings onto a public channel needs a little prep! Fortunately there were already flowers in the living room but I did dig out the mobile sculpture in the background which often gets knocked and falls apart so usually lives in a cupboard. Quick tidy up, arange the table, put the nice cushion in view and off we go!

<h4>Working</h4>
<p>
  Our usuall deep work sessions are done live with others working alongside you.  However I found a very similar feeling when filming myself. The intention of working solidly for 25mins and having an 'observer' really helped keep my focus.  I looked a bit grump and serious to start but soon got into the flow and started enjoying myself.

<h4>Working with me</h4>
<p>
  At the time of writing this a very exciting 46 views of my video.  Am sure a big chunk of that is colleagues friends to start with.  All of us at FLOWN have been checking out eachothers videos (see the full set <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@flown_space">here</a>.
