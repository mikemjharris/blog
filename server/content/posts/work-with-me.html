  At <a href="https://flown.com">FLOWN</a>, the start-up I'm working at, we provide a range of live and on demand sessions and tools to help people work more effectively. Our premium on demand '<a href="https://flown.com/portholes">portholes</a>' are beautifully shot and staged. At the other end of the scale (and something we offer for free on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@flown_space">YouTube channel</a>) is a range of videos the team have shot of themselves working.  Here's my 25min video:

<h4>Why do this?</h4>
<p>
  Why film myself?  Why provide this for others?  We touch on this in the <a href="https://flown.com/science-behind-flown">science behind FLOWN</a> blog post and others have written about effects such as how <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-doubling-productivity-adhd-wfhhttps://www.refinery29.com/en-us/body-doubling-productivity-adhd-wfh">body doubling can boost productivity</a>.

  In short - seeing others work helps put you in the mood.

<h4>Setting the scene</h4>
<p>
  Obviously filming yourself and putting your surroundings onto a public channel needs a little prep. Fortunately there were already flowers in the living room but I did dig out the mobile sculpture which usually lives in a cupboard as it gets knocked over regularly. Quick tidy up, arrange the table, put the nice cushion in view and off we go!
</p>
<h4>Working</h4>
<p>
  Our usual deep work sessions (flocks) are live with others working alongside you.  I found a very similar feeling when filming myself. The intention of working solidly for 25mins (the pomodoro time) and having an 'observer' really helped keep my focus.  I looked a bit grump and serious to start but soon got into the flow - the time flew by and while this was a staged video I got a bunch of work done.

<h4>Working with me</h4>
<p>So pop along and 'work with me' and let me know how it went.</p>
