<p>
  After our talk at the <a href="/posts/magnolia-conference">Magnolia conference</a> we were contacted at MOO about appearing in a video for the Magnolia website. We have been very happy with the product and were happy to help - hopefully they will be even quicker to respond to bugs and feature requests :).  We have also just moved offices and this was an ideal opportunity to show those off.

<h4>What was it like</h4>
<p>
  It was good fun having a cameraman in the office for a day. You aren't always aware of the effort and time that goes into other peoples jobs and it was intriguing to be part of someone else's work.

<h4>Speaking</h4>
<p>
  Personally being in front of a camera is very different to being on stage.  Words and thoughts definitely got lost somewhere between brain and mouth.  Fortunately there were enough good parts to get into the video.  The other speakers were excellent! Thanks to everyone who was involved.
